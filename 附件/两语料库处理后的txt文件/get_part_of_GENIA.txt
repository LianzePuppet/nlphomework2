il

to
only

furthermore
both

it
also
was

that

these

indicate
that

have
distinct
signaling
pathways
leading
to
the

csf
gene

and
that

may
serve
as
a
novel
model
for
dissecting
the

events
involved
in
these

stimulation

antigen
receptor
tcr
induces
activation
of
multiple
tyrosine
kinases
resulting
in
phosphorylation
of
numerous
intracellular
substrates
one
substrate
is
p95vav
which
is
expressed
exclusively
in
hematopoietic
and
trophoblast
cells
it
contains
a
number
of
structural
motifs
including
src

src
homology
3
and
pleckstrin
homology
domains
and
a
putative
guanine
nucleotide
exchange
domain
the
role
of
p95vav
in
tcr
mediated
signaling
processes
is
unclear
here
we
show
that
overexpression
of
p95vav
alone
in
jurkat
t
cells
leads
to
activation
of
the
nuclear
factors
including
nfat
involved
in
interleukin
2
expression
furthermore
p95vav
synergizes
with
tcr
stimulation
in
inducing
nfat
and
interleukin
2
dependent
transcription
in
contrast
nfat
activation
by
a
g
protein
coupled
receptor
is
not
modulated
by
p95vav
overexpression
suggesting
that
the
effect
is
specific
to
the
tcr
signaling
pathways
although
removal
of
the
first
67
amino
acids
of
p95vav
activates
its
transforming
potential
in
nih
3t3
cells
this
region
appears
to
be
required
for
its
function
in
t
cells
we
further
demonstrate
that
the
p95vav
induced
nfat
activation
is
not
mimicked
by
ras
activation
though
its
function
is
dependent
upon
ras
and
raf
furthermore
the
activating
function
of
p95vav
is
blocked
by
fk506
suggesting
that
its
activity
also
depends
on
calcineurin
to
further
dissect
p95vav
involvement
in
tcr
signaling
we
analyzed
various
jurkat
mutants
deficient
in
tcr
signaling
function
or
tcr
expression
and
showed
that
an
intact
tcr
signaling
pathway
is
required
for
p95vav
to
function
however
overexpression
of
p95vav
does
not
appear
to
influence
tcr
induced
protein
tyrosine
phosphorylation
or
increases
in
cytoplasmic
free
calcium
taken
together
our
data
suggest
that
p95vav
plays
an
important
role

the

an
important
role
in
the
developmental
control
of

in
this
report
we
show
that
the
minimal
cd4
promoter
has
four
factor
binding
sites
each
of
which
is
required
for
full

using
biochemical
and

analyses
we
determined
that
multiple
nuclear
factors
bind
to
these
independent
sites
we
determined
that
an
initiator
like
sequence
present
at
the
cap
site
and
an
ets
consensus
sequence
are
required
for
full

function
we
also
demonstrate
that
the
myc
associated
zinc
finger
protein
maz
appears
to
be
the
predominant
factor
binding
to
one
of
these
sites
this
last
site
closely

shown
to
be
a
critical
element
in
the

of

we
therefore
believe
that
the
maz
transcription
factor
is
also
likely
to
play
an
important
role

the

supported

is
unclear
steroid
resistance
cannot
be
explained
by
pharmacokinetic
mechanisms
by
a
defect
in
the

of

suggesting
that
the
molecular
abnormality
lies
distal
to

these

that

impaired

in

we

conclusion
the

correlated
with

of

endogenous
or
exogenously
administered
ra
may
have
a
significant
role
in
hiv
regulation
even
a
moderate
increase
in
the
cellular
cysteine
supply
elevates
the
intracellular
glutathione
gsh
and
glutathione
disulfide
gssg
levels
and
potentiates
immunological
functions
of
lymphocytes
in

at
low
gssg
levels
t
cells
cannot
optimally
activate
the
immunologically
important
transcription
factor
nf
kappa
b
whereas
high
gssg
levels
inhibit
the
dna
binding
activity
of
nf
kappa
b
the
effects
of
gssg
are
antagonized
by
reduced
thioredoxin

as
the

tyrosine

from
the

antigen
receptor
from
cd4
and
cd8
molecules
and
from
the

beta

the
effector
phase
of
cytotoxic
t

and
il
2

functions
are
inhibited
even
by
a
partial
depletion
of
the
intracellular
gsh
pool
as
signal
transduction
is
facilitated
by
prooxidant
conditions
we
propose
that
the
well
known
immunological
consequences
of
gsh
depletion
ultimately
may
be
results
of
the
accompanying
gssg
deficiency
as
hiv
infected
patients
and
siv
infected
rhesus
macaques
have
on
the
average
significantly
decreased
plasma
cyst
e
ine
and
intracellular
gsh
levels
we
also
hypothesize
that
aids
may
be
the
consequence
of
a
gssg
deficiency
as
well
recent
data
suggest
that
the
poor
induction
of
a
t
cell
response
to
human
renal
cell
carcinoma
rcc
may
be
related
to
alterations
in
signal
transduction
pathways
we
report
that
t
cells
from
rcc
patients
have
two
alterations
in
kappa
b
motif
specific
dna
binding
activity
the
first
alteration
involves
the
constitutive
expression
of
substantial
kappa
b
binding
activity
in
nuclear
extracts
which
was
observed
in
the
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
the
magnitude
of
kappa
b
activity
in
unstimulated
patient
t
cells
was
similar
to
that
observed
in
t
cells
from
normal
individuals
that
had
been
activated
in

on
the
basis
of
western

experiments
using
antibodies
to
kappa

the
kappa

constitutively
expressed
in
t
cells
from
rcc
patients
is
composed
mostly
of
the
nf
kappa
b1
p50
subunit
the
second
abnormality
in
kappa
b
binding
activity
in
t
cells
from
these
patients
is
that
rela
a
member
of
the
rel

family
which
is
part
of
the
normal
nf

b
complex
was
not
induced
in
the
nucleus
following

western

did
not
detect
any
rela
in
nuclear
extracts
either
before
or
after
stimulation
of
t
cells
the
altered
kappa
b
binding
activity
in
t
cells
from
rcc

may
impair
their

background
understanding
the
mechanism
of
developmental
regulation
of

has
scientific
as
well
as
clinical

because
of
the
influence
of

hemoglobin
hbf
production
in
adulthood
on
the
clinical
manifestation
of
thalassemia
and
sickle

we
have
previously
found
that
the
normal

of

expression
are
recapitulated
in
an
experimental
system
of
primary
cultures
that
support
differentiation
of

we
further
found
that
high
activities
of
the
transcriptional
activators
gata

and
sp1
are
associated
with
normal
adult
erythroid
differentiation
materials
and
methods
in
the
present
work
we
have
studied
the
activities
of

and
sp1
during
differentiation
of
cultured
erythroid
progenitors
derived

the
results
showed
high
gata
1
binding
activity
and
very
low
sp1
activity
in
the
fetal
liver
cultures
this
pattern
was
in
contrast
to
cultures
derived
from
normal
adult
peripheral
blood
in
which
both
gata

sp1
activities
were
high
cord

cultures
showed
an
additive
combination
of

the

a

in
cultures
of

beta

without

observed
conclusions
in
the
present
work
we
show
that
human
fetal
and
adult
erythroid
progenitors
are
distinct
in
their
transcription
factors
and
that
the
commitment
to
fetal
or
adult
program
occurs
at
a
very
early
differentiation
stage
our
studies
also
demonstrate
that
under
anemic
stress
recruitment
of
fetal
progenitors
may
occur
in
adulthood
we
identified
i

as
an
immediate

gene
in
human

that
is
expressed
in
response
to
a
variety
of
signals
including
adhesion
lipopolysaccharide
and
phorbol
myristate
acetate
within
5
min
of
monocyte
adhesion
the
level
of
the
i
kappa
b
alpha
protein
is
markedly
diminished
but
is
rapidly
replaced
in
a
cycloheximide
sensitive
manner
within
20
min
accompanying
the
rapid
turnover

can
regulate

the

remained

the

was
also
not
a

in

were

in

cytoplasmic
levels
of

increased
during

whereas
those
of

did
not
taken
together
our

suggest
that
two
interactive
mechanisms
regulate
monocytic
i
kappa
b
alpha

3
mrna

we
propose
that
adherent
monocytes
regulate
nuclear
processing
or
decay
of
i
kappa
b

mrna
thereby
increasing
mrna
levels
without
stimulating
i
kappa
b

gene
transcription
moreover
since
inhibition
of

synthesis
leads
to
accumulation
of
i

b
alpha
mad
3
mrna
without
stimulating
i
kappa

we
suggest
that
low

indicating
that

may
be
important
for

with

promoted
the

with

at

two
distinct

with

the

domain
located
within

and
surprisingly
the

whereas
ligand

activity
correlated
with

with

bhlh
hsp90
interaction
appeared
to
be
important
for
dna
binding
activity
but
not
for
dimerization
of
the
receptor
several
distinct
roles
for
hsp90
in
modulating
dioxin

function
are
therefore
likely
correct
folding
of

thus
the

not
c

suggesting
that

selectively
activates

that

regulate

also

in

cellular
nf

was
phosphorylation
dependent
and
the

activity
of
p65
containing
nf
kappa
b
was
enhanced
by
phosphorylation
in

furthermore
we
found
that
the
induction
by
hydrogen
peroxide
of
nf
kappa
b
translocation
to
the
nucleus
which
is
assumed
to
be
triggered
by

also
coincided
with
incorporation
of
phosphate
into
the

subunits
that
were
modified
after

appears
to
be

this

p65
complex

produced
an

novel
faster

complex
as
judged
by

it
is
surprising
that
the
faster

complex
was
composed
also
of
p50
and
p65
however
the
p65
subunit
was
cooh
terminally
truncated
as
shown
by
immunoprecipitation
the
truncation
resulted
from
limited
proteolysis
of
p65
during
cellular
extraction
which
released
particular
lysosomal
serine
proteases
such
as
elastase
cathepsin
g
and
proteinase

these
specific
proteases
are
coordinately
expressed
and
were
present
exclusively
in
the
minus
u937
clones
but
not
in
the
plus
clones
as
demonstrated
in
the
case
of
cathepsin

in
addition
these
proteases
were
detected
in
certain
subclones
of

and
in

in
each
case
correlating
with
the

we
demonstrate
in

cleavage
of
p65
by
purified
elastase
and
cathepsin
g
it
is
possible
that
particular
serine
proteases
may
have
inhibiting
effects
on
the
replication
of

the

the

we

show
that
a

inhibits
the

of

whereas
incubation
with
increasing
extracellular
concentrations
of
cysteine
inhibits
the
dna
binding
and
transactivating
activity
of

b
because
inhibition
of

is
associated
with

be

our

may
be
sensitive

only
against

we
demonstrated
that
il

occurred
exclusively
at

and
that
the
bimodal
increase
of

can
be
accounted
for
by
a
biphasic

of

furthermore
our

point
to
two

the

indicate
that
these

inclusion

these

the
hypothesis
that
ltr

assist
sivsmmpbj14
in

a

for

the

therefore
the

vary
depending
on
the
mode
of
t

and
the

our
results
suggest
that
the
target
of
pge2
action
is
a
component
in
the
signal
transduction
pathway
leading
to
the

c
however
the
inhibition
of
the

by
pge2
is
selective

enhanced
the

it
seems
therefore
that

interferes
with

further

in

it
allows
separation

this
