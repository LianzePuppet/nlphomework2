these

the

in

despite

furthermore

these

this

this

for
both

the

the

appeared
to

further
clinical

this

are

p53

are
classified
into
two

the

has
a

over

we
previously
showed
that
the

that

besides

in

we
investigated

meanwhile
in

were
significantly

these

indicate
that
the

have
a

even
if

led
to
decreased

this
may
allow

the

revealed
an

these

furthermore

thus

it

that

here
we
combine

unexpectedly
only

such

our

aacr
mutation
in

is
a
common
genetic
alteration
in
human
cancers
certain
tumor
associated
p53
missense
mutants
acquire
gain
of

gof
properties
and
confer
oncogenic

including
enhanced

the
colorectal
cancers
crc
harboring
mutant
p53
are
generally
aggressive
in
nature
and
difficult
to
treat
to
identify
a
potential
gene
expression
signature
of
gof
mutant
p53
driven
acquired
chemoresistance
in
crc
we
performed
transcriptome
profiling
of
floxuridine
fudr

sw480
cells
expressing

r273h
geo

we
obtained
several
genes
differentially
regulated
between
fudr
treated
and
untreated

further
functional
characterization
and
pathway
analysis
revealed
significant
enrichment
of
crucial
biological
processes
and
pathways
upon
fudr
treatment
in
sw480

our
data
suggest
that
in
response
to
chemotherapeutics
treatment
cancer
cells
with
gof
mutant
p53
can
modulate
key
cellular
pathways
to
withstand
the
cytotoxic

of
the

the
genes
and

identified
in
the

can
be
further
validated

harboring

exome

studies
have
identified
multiple
genes
harboring

loss

lof
variants
in
individuals
with
autism
spectrum
disorders
asd
including
tbr1
a
master
regulator
of
cortical
development
we
performed
chip
seq
for
tbr1
during
mouse
cortical
neurogenesis
and
show
that
tbr1
bound
regions
are
enriched
adjacent
to
asd
genes
asd
genes
were
also
enriched
among
genes
that
are
differentially
expressed
in
tbr1
knockouts
which
together
with
the
chip
seq
data
suggests
direct
transcriptional
regulation
of
the
nine
asd
genes
examined
seven
were
misexpressed
in
the
cortices
of
tbr1
knockout
mice
including
six
with
increased
expression
in
the
deep
cortical

asd
genes
with
adjacent
cortical
tbr1
chip
seq
peaks
also
showed
unusually
low
levels
of
lof
mutations
in
a
reference
human
population
and
among
icelanders
we
then
leveraged
tbr1
binding
to
identify
an
appealing
subset
of
candidate
asd
genes
our
findings
highlight
a
tbr1
regulated
network
of
asd
genes
in
the
developing
neocortex
that
are
relatively
intolerant
to
lof
mutations
indicating
that
these
genes
may
play
critical
roles
in
normal
cortical
development
the
p53
tumor
suppressor
gene
encodes
a
sequence
specific
transcription
factor
mutations
in
the
coding
sequence
of
p53
occur
frequently
in
human
cancer
and
often
result
in
single
amino
acid
substitutions
missense
mutations
in
the
dna
binding
domain
dbd
blocking
normal
tumor
suppressive
functions
in
addition
to
the
loss
of
canonical
functions
some
missense
mutations
in
p53
confer
gain
of
function
gof
activities
to
tumor
cells
while
many
missense
mutations
in
p53
cluster
at
six
hotspot
amino
acids
the
majority
of
mutations
in
human
cancer
occur
elsewhere
in
the
dbd
and
at
a
much
lower
frequency
we
report
here
that
mutations
at
k120
a
non
hotspot
dna
contact
residue
confer
p53
with
the
previously
unrecognized
ability
to
bind
and
activate
the
transcription
of
the
pro

tnfaip8
gene
mutant
k120
p53
binds
the
tnfaip8
locus
at
a
cryptic
p53
response
element
that
is
not
occupied
by
wild
type
p53
furthermore
induction
of
tnfaip8
is
critical
for
the
evasion
of
apoptosis
by
tumor
cells
expressing
the
k120r
variant
of
p53
these
findings
identify
induction
of
pro
survival
targets
as
a
mechanism
of
gain
of
function
activity
for
mutant
p53
and
will
likely
broaden
our
understanding
of
this
phenomenon
beyond
the
limited
number
of
gof
activities
currently
reported
for
hotspot

the
overall
understanding
of
the
molecular

however
detailed

conclusively
confirming
these

as
the

both
loss

however
it

in

we
demonstrate
that

however

we
introduced

the

and
the

both
of

the

apc
causing

in

tumors
the
apc
protein

still

objective
methods
here
we
tested
the
hypothesis
that
extracellular

of
the

although
acting
upstream
of
the
apc

can
restore
normal

of

in

to
this

we

our

that

exists
as

it
is
not

we
discovered
a

and
accounting

to

despite
this
major

of

the

appears
to
be
very
rare
in

and
likely
explains
only
a

of

this

is
thought
to
be
counterbalanced
by
the

as
only

have
been

to
be

to

these

we
found
that

was
not

with

whereas
kcnh2
p

a

our

were
lower
in

these

imply
that

prevents

this

can
be
abolished
by

these

that
the

pathologically
by
the

dopaminergic

recent
evidence
has
suggested
a
role
of
lrrk2
linked
to
the
most
frequent
familial
pd
in
regulating
synaptic
vesicle
sv
trafficking
however
the
mechanism
whereby
lrrk2
mutants
contribute
to
nigral
vulnerability
remains
unclear
here
we
show
that
the
most
common
pd
mutation
lrrk2
g2019s
impairs
sv
endocytosis
in
ventral
midbrain
mb
neurons
including
da
neurons
and
the
slowed
endocytosis
can
be
rescued
by
inhibition
of
lrrk2
kinase
activity
a
similar
endocytic
defect
however
was
not
observed
in
lrrk2
mutant

from
the
neocortex
hereafter
cortical
neurons
or
the
hippocampus
suggesting
a
brain
region
specific
vulnerability
to
the
g2019s
mutation
additionally
we
found
mb
specific
impairment
of
sv
endocytosis
in
neurons
carrying
heterozygous
deletion
of
synj1
park20
a
gene
that
is
associated
with
recessive
parkinsonism
combining
synj1
and
lrrk2
g2019s
does
not
exacerbate
sv
endocytosis
but
impairs
sustained
exocytosis
in
mb
neurons
and
alters
specific
motor
functions
of
1
year
old
male
mice
interestingly
we
show
that
lrrk2
directly
phosphorylates
synaptojanin1
in

resulting
in
the
disruption
of
endophilin
synaptojanin1
interaction
required
for
sv
endocytosis
our
work
suggests
a
merge
of
lrrk2
and
synj1
pathogenic
pathways
in
deregulating
sv
trafficking
in
mb
neurons
as
an
underlying
molecular
mechanism
of

significance
statement
understanding

selective

in

is
essential
for
the
development
of
targeted
therapeutics
we
report
for
the
first
time
a
nerve

in
sv

selectively
in
mb

but
not
cortical

caused
by
two
park

lrrk2
park8
and
synj1
park20
we
demonstrate
that
the
enhanced
kinase
activity
resulting
from
the
most
frequent
g2019s
mutation
in
lrrk2
is
the
key
to
this
impairment
we
provide
evidence
suggesting
that
lrrk2
g2019s
and
synj1
loss
of
function
share
a
similar
pathogenic
pathway
in
deregulating
daergic
neuron
sv
endocytosis
and
that
they
play
additive
roles
in
facilitating
each
other
s
pathogenic

in

various

further

immune
evasion
is
a
well
recognized
hallmark
of
cancer
and
recent
studies
with
immunotherapy
agents
have
suggested
that
tumors
with
increased
numbers
of
neoantigens
elicit
greater
immune
responses
we
hypothesized
that
the
immune
system
presents
a
common
selective

on
high

burden
tumors
and
therefore
immune
evasion
mutations
would
be
enriched
in
high

tumors
the

family
of

is
required
for
the

of
a

in

therefore
we
analyzed
alterations
in

the

data
to
confirm

our

by
analyzing

recurrent

with

and
microsatellite

these

occurred
in
multiple
tumor

including
endometrial
colorectal
stomach
and
prostate

analyzing
gene

in
endometrial

adenocarcinomas
revealed
that
tumors
with
a
jak1

exhibited
reduced
expression
of
interferon

signatures
and
multiple
anti

importantly
endometrial

exhibited

that

a

2
the
mechanism
by
which

is
likely
associated
with

however
the

we

here
that

while
the

a

legionella
pneumophila
is
the
causative
agent
of
a
severe

called

a

the

has
been

of

here
a

in

both

using

and

specifically
loss

resulted
in

of

which

immune

the
effector

ravy
and
lpg2505
were
important
for
efficient
replication
within
both
mammalian
and
protozoan
hosts
further
analysis
of

revealed
that
this
protein
functions
as
a
metaeffector
that
counteracts
host

displayed
by
the

thus
this

identified
a

the

the

presenilin
can
impart
sufficient
notch

for
the
establishment

expansion
of
the

but
maintenance
of
an
adult
stem
cell

relies
exclusively
on
hop

we
also
show
that

is
necessary
for

the

can
be
phenocopied
by

we
propose
that
at

end
of

dual

switches
exclusively
to

perhaps
offering
opportunities
for
differential

during

additional
defects
in

in

indicate
that
the
process

we

as
much
as

this
work
suggests
that
an
important
role
for

in
the

is
to
furnish
a
large
and

of
nurse

the
adaptive
telomere
failure
hypothesis
suggests
that
certain
environmental
stresses
can
induce
a
low
level
of
telomere
failure
potentially
leading
to
elevated
subtelomeric
recombination
that
could
result
in
adaptive
mutational
changes
within
subtelomeric
genes
here
we
tested
a
key
prediction
of
the
adaptive
telomere
failure
hypothesis
that
telomere
dysfunction
mild
enough
to
have
little
or
no
overall
effect
on
cell
fitness
could
still
lead
to
substantial
increases
in
the
mutation
rates
of
subtelomeric
genes
our
results
show
that
a
mutant
of
kluyveromyces
lactis
with
stably
short
telomeres
produced
a
large
increase
in
the
frequency
of
mutations
affecting
the
native
subtelomeric
galactosidase
lac4
gene
all
lac4
mutants
examined
from
strains
with
severe
telomere

underwent
terminal
deletion
duplication
events
consistent
with
being
due
to
break

replication
in

although
cells
with
mild
telomere
dysfunction
also
exhibited
similar
terminal
deletion
and
duplication
events
up
to
50
of
lac4
mutants
from
this
background
unexpectedly
contained
base
changes
within
the

this
mutational
bias
for
producing

demonstrates
that

can
be
well

our

these

clinical

have

in

igf1r

partly
because

thus

more

igf1r

in

to

we

we
identified
a

and
showed

we
show
that

are

furthermore
we
identified
a

in

this

biochemical

however
the

displays
increased

to
an

suggesting
the

using

the

our

suggest
that
phosphorylation
of
snipps
accumulates

dissipates
in

to
sleep

and
therefore
snipp
phosphorylation
is
a
molecular
signature
of
sleep

whereas
waking
encodes

by
potentiating

sleep
consolidates

and
restores

thus
the

of

a

function
variant
in
the
gene
encoding
the
prolactin
receptor
prlr
was
reported
previously
in
a
woman
with
persistent
postpartum
galactorrhea
however
this
paradoxical
phenotype
is
not
completely
understood
here
we
describe
a
35
year
old
woman
who
presented
with
idiopathic
hyperprolactinemia
that
was
associated
with
a
complete
lack
of
lactation
after
each
of
her
two
deliveries
she
is
a
compound
heterozygote
for
loss
of
function
variants
of
prlr
her
unaffected
parents
are
heterozygotes
these
findings
are
consistent
with
previous
work
showing
that
mice
deficient
in
functional
prlr
do
not
lactate

the
wrky
transcription
factor
wrky12
negatively
regulates
cd

in
arabidopsis
via
the
glutathione

pathway
by
directly
targeting

expression
cadmium
cd
is
a
widespread
pollutant
toxic
to
plants
the
glutathione
gsh
dependent
phytochelatin
pc
synthesis
pathway
plays
key
roles
in
cd
detoxification
however
its
regulatory
mechanism
remains
largely
unknown
here
we
showed
a
previously
unknown
function
of
the
wrky
transcription
factor
wrky12
in
the
regulation
of
cd
tolerance
by
repressing
the
expression
of
pc
synthesis
related
genes
the
expression
of
wrky12
was
inhibited
by
cd
stress
enhanced
cd
tolerance
was
observed
in
the
wrky12
loss
of
function
mutants
whereas
increased
cd
sensitivity
was
found
in
the
wrky12
overexpressing
plants
overexpression
and
loss
of
function
of
wrky12
were
associated
respectively
with
increased
and
decreased
cd
accumulation
by
repressing
or
releasing
the
expression
of
the
genes
involved
in
the
pc
synthesis
pathway
transient
expression
assay
showed
that
wrky12
repressed
the
expression
of
gsh1
gsh2
pcs1
and
pcs2
further
analysis
indicated
that
wrky12
could
directly
bind
to
the
w
box
of
the
promoter
in
gsh1
but
not
in
gsh2
pcs1
and
pcs2
in
vivo
together
our
results
suggest
that
wrky12
directly
targets
gsh1
and
indirectly
represses
pc
synthesis
related
gene
expression
to
negatively
regulate
cd
accumulation
and
tolerance

yet
the

which
have

in

of

can
only
explain
the

here

to
elucidate
the
mechanisms
of

functioning
in
sperm
flagellar
formation
we
perform
proteomic
analysis
on
the
testes
of
ko
and
wild
type
mice
furthermore
in

experiments
indicate
that
qrich2
is
involved
in
sperm
flagellar
development
through
stabilizing
and
enhancing
the
expression
of
proteins
related
to
flagellar
development
our
findings
strongly
suggest
that
the
genetic
mutations
of
human
qrich2
can
lead
to
male
infertility
with
mmaf
and
that
qrich2
is
essential
for
sperm
flagellar
formation
