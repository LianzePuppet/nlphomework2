we

the

these

suggest
that

differs
from

the
main
difference
is
that
with

no

that

ebv
remains
in

from

a

these

indicate

have

leading

of

one
substrate
is

it

and
a

the
role
of

in
tcr

processes
is
unclear
here
we
show
that

alone
in

leads
to
activation
of
the
nuclear

including
nfat
involved

furthermore
p95vav
synergizes
with

stimulation
in
inducing
nfat
and
interleukin

in
contrast
nfat
activation
by
a

coupled

is
not
modulated
by
p95vav

suggesting
that
the
effect
is
specific
to
the
tcr

pathways
although
removal
of
the
first
67
amino

of

activates
its

potential
in
nih
3t3

this
region
appears
to
be
required
for
its
function
in

we
further
demonstrate
that
the
p95vav
induced
nfat
activation
is
not
mimicked
by
ras
activation
though
its
function
is
dependent
upon
ras
and
raf
furthermore
the
activating
function
of
p95vav
is
blocked
by

suggesting
that
its

also
depends
on

the

plays
an
important
role
in
the
developmental
control
of
cd4

in
this
report
we
show
that
the
minimal
cd4
promoter
has
four
factor
binding
sites
each
of
which
is
required
for
full
function
using
biochemical
and
mutagenesis
analyses
we
determined
that
multiple
nuclear
factors
bind
to
these
independent
sites
we
determined
that
an
initiator
like
sequence
present
at
the
cap
site
and
an
ets
consensus
sequence
are
required
for
full
promoter
function
we
also
demonstrate
that
the
myc
associated
zinc
finger
protein
maz
appears
to
be
the
predominant
factor
binding
to
one
of
these

this

previously
shown
to
be
a

element
in

of

we
therefore
believe
that
the

is
also
likely
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
control

we

the

our

however

the
main

between

in

our

indicate
that
synergy
between
the

is
needed
for
efficient
c

since
neither

that

of

for
the

is
supported
by
the
fact
that

these

the

the

moreover
the

that

a

the
molecular
mechanism
for
this
steroid

is
unclear
steroid
resistance
cannot
be
explained
by
pharmacokinetic
mechanisms
by
a
defect
in
the
binding
of
steroids
to
glucocorticoid

nor
by
defective
nuclear
translocation
of
this

thereby
suggesting
that
the
molecular
abnormality
lies
distal
to

scatchard

change
in

but
did
show
a
reduced

these
results
suggest
that
the
ability
of
the

to
bind
to

is
impaired
in

patients
because
of
a
reduced

however
it

whether
this

to
explain

in

when

it
is
possible
that

we
show
that

can
replicate
in

and
the

produced
from

can
infect

it
was
found
that
the

less

of

was
restricted
to

the
intracellular

of

is
unknown
the
objective
of
this
study
was
to
investigate
the
involvement
of
the
newly
discovered
jak
stat
pathway
in
the
il

signal
transduction
mechanism
eosinophils
were
purified
from
peripheral
blood
by
discontinuous
percoll
gradients
and
stimulated
with
il

the
involvement
of
jak

was
investigated
by
immunoprecipitation
followed
by
immunoblotting
for
tyrosine
phosphorylation
the
activation
of
jak
2
was
studied
by
autophosphorylation
of
the
immunoprecipitated

jak
2
was
tyrosine
phosphorylated
within

to
3
min
after
stimulation
of
eosinophils
with
il

further
the
immunoprecipitated
jak

obtained
from
il

stimulated
cells
underwent
autophosphorylation
jak

coprecipitated
with
the
beta

of
the
il

receptor
suggesting
a
physical
association
of
the

with
the

the
nuclear

stat

p91
was
investigated
by
immunoprecipitation
followed
by
immunoblotting
for
tyrosine
phosphorylation
stat
1
was
tyrosine
phosphorylated
within
15
min
of
il
5
stimulation
the
presence
of
stat

in
the
nuclear

was
studied
by
electrophoretic
mobility

assay
il

induced
two

that
bound
to
the
gamma

sequence
in
the
presence
of
an
anti

ab
the

was
supershifted
thus
we
demonstrated
that
il
5
activated
the
jak
2
stat
1
signaling
pathway
in
eosinophils
we
speculate
that
the
jak
2
stat

pathway
may
be
involved
in
the
activation
of
il
5
inducible
genes
in
eosinophils

was
significantly
decreased
when

p

the
degree
of
the

in
pha

of

depended
upon
the

as
manifested
by

in

dropped
significantly
in

only
after
an

12

pha

similar
in

in
those
receiving

p

but
in
all

p
0
001
when
data
obtained
preoperatively
and
after
12
months
were
compared
it
was
found
that
out
of
23
patients
whose
pbmcs
had
experienced
a
drop
in
their
pha

had
developed
metastatic

within
the
subsequent
24

36

in

out
of
59

showed
an
increase
in
their
pha
induced
proliferation
within
the
first
12
months
after

only

presented
with
disease
progression
we
thus
conclude
that
pha
induced
proliferation
of
pbmcs
derived
from
patients
with
breast
cancer
depends
upon
the
tumour
load
and
is
a
good

a

been

that

mutations
in

abolished

decreased

always

the

of

the

of

one

three

also
tested
for

451
twofold
in

although
it
had
no

in

transcriptional

by
cbf

required
binding
to
the
cbf

subunit
as
a
form
of
cbf
beta
that
lacked
binding
ability
cbf
beta
148
failed
to
increase

these
results
indicated
that
at
least
in
certain
cell
types
the
maximum
activity
of
cbf
required
both
subunits
they
also
provided
support
for
the
hypothesis
that
cbf
is
a
factor
in
t
lymphocytes
that
is
responsible
for
recognition
of
the
sl3
cores
we
also
examined
whether
cbf
could
distinguish
a
1
bp
difference
between
the
enhancer
core
of
sl3
and
the
core
of
the
nonleukemogenic

akv
this
difference
strongly
affects
transcription
in

and
leukemogenicity
of

however
no
combination
of
cbf
alpha
and
cbf
beta
subunits
that
we
tested
was
able
to
distinguish
the
1

difference
in
transcription
assays
thus
a
complete
understanding
of
how
t
cells
recognize
the
sl3
core
remains
to
be
elucidated
our

these

nfatp

thus
although
the

it
appears
to
function
as
a

the

however

these

we

from

that

we

first
we

furthermore

however
the

leading

a
prevailing
hypothesis
postulates
induction
of

by

in

we
show
that

in

of

furthermore
we

can
also
induce

through
the

receptor
whose
repressive
functions
but
not

are
similar
to
those
of

therefore
the
primary
effect
of

in

correlates
with

rather
than

could
be
mediated

whereas

inhibit
the

the

these

trigger

and
transduce

from

the

are
inhibited
even
by
a
partial
depletion
of
the
intracellular

as
signal

is
facilitated
by
prooxidant
conditions
we
propose
that
the
well
known
immunological
consequences
of
gsh

ultimately
may
be
results
of
the
accompanying
gssg

as

and
siv

rhesus
macaques
have
on
the
average
significantly
decreased
plasma

intracellular

we
also
hypothesize
that
aids
may
be
the
consequence
of
a
gssg

as
well
recent
data
suggest
that
the
poor
induction
of
a
t
cell
response
to
human
renal
cell
carcinoma
rcc
may
be
related
to
alterations
in
signal
transduction
pathways
we
report
that
t
cells
from
rcc
patients
have
two
alterations
in
kappa
b
motif
specific
dna
binding
activity
the
first
alteration
involves
the
constitutive
expression
of
substantial
kappa
b
binding
activity
in
nuclear
extracts
which
was
observed
in
the
electrophoretic
mobility
shift
assay
the
magnitude
of
kappa
b
activity
in
unstimulated
patient
t
cells
was
similar
to
that
observed
in
t
cells
from
normal
individuals
that
had
been
activated
in

on
the
basis
of
western

experiments
using
antibodies
to
kappa
b
rel
family
proteins
the
kappa
b
binding
activity
constitutively
expressed
in
t
cells
from
rcc
patients
is
composed
mostly
of
the
nf
kappa
b1
p50
subunit
the
second
abnormality
in
kappa
b
binding
activity
in
t
cells
from
these
patients
is
that
rela
a
member
of
the
rel

family
which
is
part
of
the
normal
nf
kappa

was
not
induced
in
the

following

western

analysis
did
not
detect
any
rela
in
nuclear

either
before
or
after
stimulation
of
t
cells
the
altered
kappa
b
binding
activity
in
t
cells
from
rcc
patients
may
impair
their
capacity
to
respond
normally
to
various

background
understanding
the
mechanism
of
developmental
regulation
of
hemoglobin
switching
has
scientific
as
well
as
clinical
relevance
because
of
the
influence
of
fetal
hemoglobin
hbf
production
in
adulthood
on
the
clinical
manifestation
of
thalassemia
and
sickle
cell
anemia
we
have
previously
found
that
the
normal
developmental
patterns
of
globin
gene
expression
are
recapitulated
in
an
experimental
system
of
primary
cultures
that
support
differentiation
of
erythroid
progenitors
we
further
found
that
high
activities
of
the
transcriptional
activators
gata
1
and
sp1
are
associated
with
normal
adult
erythroid
differentiation
materials
and
methods
in
the
present
work
we
have
studied
the
activities
of
gata
1
and
sp1
during
differentiation
of
cultured
erythroid
progenitors
derived
from
cord
blood
and
from
fetal
livers
as
well
as
from
beta

patients
results
the
results
showed
high
gata
1
binding
activity
and
very
low
sp1
activity
in
the
fetal
liver
cultures
this
pattern
was
in
contrast
to
cultures
derived
from
normal
adult
peripheral
blood
in
which
both
gata
1
and
sp1
activities
were
high
cord
blood
cultures
showed
an
additive
combination
of
adult
and
fetal
patterns
the
progenitors
derived
from
a
beta
zero
thalassemia
patient
with
high
hbf
production
showed
fetal
pattern
on
the
other
hand
in
cultures
of
2
beta
zero
thalassemia
patients
without
high
hbf
adult
pattern
was
observed
conclusions
in
the
present
work
we
show
that
human
fetal
and
adult
erythroid
progenitors
are
distinct
in
their
transcription
factors
and
that
the
commitment
to
fetal
or
adult
program
occurs
at
a
very
early
differentiation
stage
our
studies
also
demonstrate
that
under
anemic
stress
recruitment
of
fetal
progenitors
may
occur
in
adulthood
we
identified
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
as
an
immediate
early
gene
in
human
monocytes
that
is
expressed
in
response
to
a
variety
of
signals
including
adhesion
lipopolysaccharide
and
phorbol
myristate
acetate
within
5
min
of
monocyte
adhesion
the
level
of
the
i
kappa
b
alpha
protein
is
markedly
diminished
but
is
rapidly
replaced
in
a
cycloheximide
sensitive
manner
within
20
min
accompanying
the
rapid
turnover
of
the
i
kappa
b
alpha
protein
is
simultaneous
translocation
of
nf
kappa

related

factors
to
nuclei
of

the
demonstration
that
nf
kappa
b
can
regulate
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
gene
transcription
in
other
cell
types
suggested
that
the
rapid
increase
in
steady
state
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
mrna
levels
we
observed
within
30
min
of
monocyte
adherence
would
result
from
nf
kappa
b
dependent
transcriptional
stimulation
of
the
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
gene
nuclear
run
on
analyses
indicated
that
instead
while
several
immediate
early
cytokine
genes
such
as
the
interleukin
1
beta
il

beta
gene
were
transcriptionally
activated
during
monocyte
adhesion
the
rate
of
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
gene
transcription
remained
constant
the
adherence
dependent
increase
in
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
mrna
levels
was
also
not
a
consequence
of
mrna
stabilization
events
interestingly
while
increases
in
both
il
1
beta
and
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
mrna
levels
were
detected
in
nuclei
of
adherent
monocytes
cytoplasmic
levels
of
il
1
beta
mrna
increased
during
adherence
whereas
those
of
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
mrna
did
not
taken
together
our
data
suggest
that
two
interactive
mechanisms
regulate
monocytic
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
mrna
levels
we
propose
that
adherent
monocytes
regulate
nuclear
processing
or
decay
of
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
mrna
thereby
increasing
mrna
levels
without
stimulating
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
gene
transcription
moreover
since
inhibition
of
protein
synthesis
leads
to
accumulation
of
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad
3
mrna
without
stimulating
i
kappa
b
alpha
mad

gene
transcription
we
suggest
that
low
cytoplasmic
levels
of
i
kappa
b
alpha

are
maintained
by
a

mechanism
the

recovered
in
an
inducible
cytoplasmic

associated
with
the

a

we
have
reconstituted

by
using

with
arnt
in
contrast
this

mutant
showed
low

indicating
that
the

may
be
important
for

and
or

of

it
was
not
possible
to
reconstitute

with

expressed
in
wheat
germ

in
line
with
these
observations
reticulocyte
lysate
but
not
wheat
germ

promoted
the
association
of
de

synthesized
dioxin
receptor
with
hsp90
at
least
two
distinct
domains
of
the
receptor
mediated
interaction
with
hsp90
the
ligand
binding
domain
located
within
the
pas
region
and
surprisingly
the
bhlh
domain
whereas
ligand
binding
activity
correlated
with
association
with
hsp90
bhlh
hsp90
interaction
appeared
to
be
important
for
dna
binding
activity
but
not
for
dimerization
of
the
receptor
several
distinct
roles
for
hsp90
in
modulating
dioxin
receptor
function
are
therefore
likely
correct
folding
of
the
ligand
binding
domain
interference
with
arnt
heterodimerization
and
folding
of
a

conformation
of

thus
the

provides

we

ald

only
in

the

these
data
suggest
that

cause

in

although
some

with

the

however
the

demonstrated
that

the

combine
to
provide
the

oct

are
human

that

we
expressed

thus
the

thereby
promoting

we

demonstrate
that

the

the
activation
of
nuclear
factor
kappa
b
nf
kappa
b
in
intact
cells
is
mechanistically
not
well
understood
therefore
we
investigated
the
modifications
imposed
on
nf
kappa
b
i
kappa
b
components
following
stimulation
and
show
that
the
final
step
of
nf
kappa
b
induction
in
vivo
involves
phosphorylation
of
several
members
of
the
nf
kappa
b
i
kappa
b
protein
families
in
hela
cells
as
well
as
in
b
cells
tnf
alpha
rapidly
induced
nuclear
translocation
primarily
of
p50
p65
but
not
of
c
rel
both
nf
kappa
b
precursors
and
i
kappa
b
alpha
became
strongly
phosphorylated
with
the
same
kinetics
in
addition
to
the
inducible
phosphorylation
after
stimulation
b
lymphocytes
containing
constitutive
nuclear
nf
kappa
b
revealed
constitutively
phosphorylated
p65
and
i
kappa
b
alpha
phosphorylation
was
accompanied
by
induced
processing
of
the
precursors
p100
and
p105
and
by
degradation
of
i
kappa
b
alpha
as
an
in
vitro
model
we
show
that
phosphorylation
of
p105
impedes
its
ability
to
interact
with
nf
kappa
b
as
has
been
shown
before
for
i
kappa
b
alpha
surprisingly
even
p65
but
not
c
rel
was
phosphorylated
after
induction
in
vivo
suggesting
that
tnf
alpha
selectively
activates
only
specific
nf
kappa
b
heteromers
and
that
modifications
regulate
not
only
i
kappa
b
molecules
but
also
nf
kappa
b
molecules
in
fact
cellular
nf
kappa
b
activity
was
phosphorylation
dependent
and
the
dna
binding
activity
of
p65
containing
nf
kappa
b
was
enhanced
by
phosphorylation
in
vitro
furthermore
we
found
that
the
induction
by
hydrogen
peroxide
of
nf
kappa
b
translocation
to
the
nucleus
which
is
assumed
to
be
triggered
by
reactive
oxygen
intermediates
also
coincided
with
incorporation
of
phosphate
into
the
same
subunits
that
were
modified
after
stimulation
by
tnf
alpha
thus
phosphorylation
appears
to
be
a
general
mechanism
for
activation
of
nf
kappa
b
in
vivo
it
is
well
documented

however
during

this

was
a
result
of
the

cd21
but
was
caused
by

the

however

the

confers

this

we
now
show
that

inhibits
the

of

whereas

with
increasing

of

inhibits
the

of

because
inhibition
of

is

and
gssg
can
be

to
inhibit

our

that

is
a

in

also
nf

controls

so
our

suggest
that

be

against

also
against

that
the

can
be
accounted
for
by
a

of

furthermore
our

point
to

the

we
demonstrate
in

our

when

not

pge2
enhanced
the
production
of
il

and
only
partially
inhibited
the

of
other

therefore
the
effects
of
pge2
vary
depending
on
the
mode
of
t
cell
activation
and
the
il

and
il

regulated
differently
from

our
results
suggest
that
the
target
of
pge2
action
is
a
component
in
the
signal

pathway
leading
to
the
activation
of

c
however
the

of

when
the

by

it
seems
therefore
that
pge2

is

mainly
at

level
of

and
that

is
required
for

we
have

these

however
all

the

the

these

this
resulted

this
may
be
the
first

another
limitation
is
that

these

further

on

we

from

in

it
allows
separation

this
allows
us

with
regard
to
their
content
of

which
become
incorporated

we

these

senescent

from

cells
in

a
second
feature
of
senescent
t
cells
is
the
dramatic
reduction
in
hsp70
production
in
response
to
heat
shock
this
decline
is
associated
with
a
decrease
in

of

to
the

interestingly
the
progressive
decline
in
the
heat

response
of

correlates
with
the
percent
proliferative
life
span
completed
rather
than
with
the
actual
proliferative
activity
at
the
time
of

this
suggests
that
for
senescent
t

the
reduced
ability
to
respond
to
heat
shock
by
producing
hsp70
although
possibly
lying
at
the
level
of
transcriptional
control
may
nevertheless
be
unrelated
to
the
reduced
dna
synthesis
or
the
diminished
proliferative
activity
also
manifested
by
these
cells
the
induction
of
the
ap

transcription
factor
has
been
ascribed
to
the
early
events
leading
to
t
lymphocyte
activation
we
have
examined
the
possibility
that
stimulation
of
phospholipase
d
pld
may
regulate
activation
of

in
human

by
transfecting

jurkat

with

and

gene
we
have
detected
activatable

in

and
we
have
found
that
addition
of
phosphatidic

pa
the
physiologic
product
of

on

is
rapidly
incorporated
into

leads
to

wortmannin
an

of
receptor
coupled
pld
activation
blocked
the
anti
cd3
induced
increases
in
both
pld

and
ap

enhancer
activity
we
found
a
good
correlation
in
the
transfected
cells
between
pld
activation
and
induction
of
ap

enhancer
activity
under
different
experimental
conditions
furthermore
ethanol
an
inhibitor
of
the
pld
pathway
blocked
the
anti
cd3
stimulated
ap
1
enhancer
activity
however
this
anti
cd3
mediated
response
was
not
inhibited
by
neomycin
an
inhibitor
of
phosphoinositide
hydrolysis
the
increases
in
ap
1
enhancer
activity
induced
by
pa
or
anti
cd3
mab
were
efficiently
abrogated
by
the
presence
of
propranolol
an
inhibitor
of
pa
phosphohydrolase
and
protein
kinase
c
pkc
furthermore
the
pa
and
the
anti
cd3
induced
increases
in
ap
1
enhancer
activity
were
blocked
by
the
presence
of
pkc
inhibitors
or
by
pkc
down
regulation
these
data
indicate
that
pld
stimulation
can
activate
the
transcription
factor
ap
1
in
t
lymphocytes
and
suggest
that
the
induction
of
ap
1
enhancer
factor
activity
by
pa
is
mediated
via
pkc
stimulation
either
through
a
direct
activating
effect
of
pa
or
through
pa
derived
diacylglycerol
formation
these
data
also
provide
evidence
for
a
role
of
pld
derived
lipids
in
the
induction
of
ap
1
enhancer
activity
resulting
from
stimulation
of
the
tcr
cd3
complex
suggesting
that
increased
pld
activity
can
play
an
important
role
in
t
lymphocyte
activation

suggested
by

however
it
was
not
possible
to
ascertain
whether
bcl
2
upregulation
was
a
specific
consequence
of
lmp1
expression
or
an
artifact
of
the
selection
procedure
whereby
rare
bcl
2
cells
already
present
in
the
starting
population
might
best
be
able
to
tolerate
the
potentially
toxic
effects
of
lmp1
we
therefore
reexamined
this
issue
by
using
two
different
experimental
approaches
that
allowed
lmp1
induced
effects
to
be
monitored
immediately
following
expression
of
the
viral
protein
and
in
the
absence
of
selective
pressures
activation
of
the
nf
kappa
b
transcription
factor
and
upregulation
of
the
cell
adhesion
molecule
icam

were
used
as
early
indices
of
lmp1
function
in
the
first
approach
stable
clones
of
two
b
cell
lines
carrying
an
lmp1
gene
under
the
control
of
an
inducible
metallothionein
promoter
were
induced
to
express
lmp1
in
all
cells
activation
of
nk
kappa
b
and
upregulation
of
icam
1
occurred
within
24
h
and
were
followed
at
48
to
72
h
by
upregulation
of
bcl
2
in
the
second
approach
we
tested
the
generality
of
this
phenomenon
by
transiently
expressing
lmp1
from
a
strong
constitutively
active
promoter
in
a
range
of
different
cell
types
all
six
b
cell
lines
tested
showed
nf
kappa
b
activation
in
response
to
lmp1
expression
and
this
was
followed
in
five
of
six
lines
by
expression
of
icam
1
and
bcl
2
in
the
same
experiments
all
three
non
b
cell
lines
showed
nf
kappa
b
activation
and
icam
1
upregulation
but
never
any
effect
upon
bcl
2
we
therefore
conclude
that
bcl
2
upregulation
is
part
of
the
panoply
of
cellular
changes
induced
by
lmp1
but
that
the
effect
is
cell
type
specific
our
data
also
suggest
that
whilst
nf
kappa
b
may
be
an
essential
component
of
lmp1
signal
transduction
other
cell
specific
factors
may
be
required
to
effect
some
functions
of
the

the

of

that
differ
in
their

which
causes

but
is
unable
to
activate

without

and

which
stimulates

on
its
own
we
found
that
tyrosine

was
similar
for
both
mabs
over
a
period
of
hours
however
the
inositol

response
was
stronger
for
64

than
for
okt3
to
tie
these
events
to
gene
activation
we
measured
nf
kappa
b
and
nf
at
activity
in
the
nucleus
after
anti

both

these

correlated

the

these

the

that

the

from

the

in
contrast
to
earlier
hypotheses
which
suggested
that
the
endocrine

was
of
neuroectodermal

it
is
thus
generally
believed
that
the
pancreatic
endocrine
lineage
possesses
the
ability
to
mature
along
a
differentiation

that
shares
many
characteristics
with

in

the

summarizes
these

with
a
special
focus
on
our
own

on
pluripotent

cultures
of

previous
analyses
of

has
led
to
the
discovery
of
a
common
octamer
motif
which
is
functionally
important
in
the

developmentally
regulated
transcriptional

of

genes
the

segments

also
contain
an

as
the
variant
octamer
which
has
been
shown
previously
to
bind

transcription
factors
in

to
further
elucidate
the
role
of
this
variant
octamer
motif
in
the
regulation
of
germline
transcription
from
the
unrearranged

locus
we
have
quantitated
the
relative
binding
affinity
of
oct
1
and
oct
2
for
the
variant
octamer
motif
and
determined
the
functional
role
of
this
octamer
motif
in
transcriptional
activation
we
find
that
although
the
variant
octamer
motif
binds
oct
1
and
oct
2
in

with
5
fold
lower
affinity
than
the
consensus
octamer
motif
mutation
of
the
variant
octamer
motif
to
either
a
consensus
octamer
or
non
octamer
motif
has
no
effect
on
transcriptional
activation
from
the
germline
promoter
we
also
find
significant
differences
in
activation
of
germline
and
v
region
promoters
by
kappa
enhancers
our
results
suggest
that
the
germline
promoters
and
v
region
promoters
differ
in
their
dependence
on
octamer
for
activation
and
respond
differently
to
enhancer
activation
these
findings
have
important
implications
in
regulation
of
germline
transcription
as
well
as
concomitant
activation
of
the
v

recombination
of
the
kappa
light

locus
we
previously
showed
that
granulocyte
macrophage

and

stimulate
the
differentiation
of
human

into
two
phenotypically
distinct
types
of
macrophages
however
in
vivo
not
only
csf
but
also
many
other
cytokines
are
produced
under
various
conditions
those
cytokines
may
modulate
the
differentiation
of
monocytes
by
csfs
in
the
present
study
we
showed
that

respectively
taken
together
these
results
provide
a
new
aspect
to
our

and
provide
evidence
that
human

are
flexible
in
their

and
are
precursors
not

of

but
also

such
a
diverse
pathway
of
monocyte
differentiation
may
constitute
one
of
the
basic
mechanisms
of
immune

tepoxalin
a
dual
enzyme
inhibitor
of
cyclooxygenase
and
5
lipoxygenase
has
been
shown
to
inhibit
t
cell
activation
its
immunosuppressive
property
is
distinct
from
cyclosporin
because
only
tepoxalin
but
not
cyclosporin
suppresses

here
we

the

that

rapid
tyrosine

of

is
a

in

of

to

the
regulatory

of
protein
tyrosine

ptpases
in
this

was
explored
by
studying
the
effects
of
a
powerful

vanadate

pervanadate
on
the

of

pervanadate
induced

of
the

respectively
and
a
dramatic
increase
in
tyrosine

of
cellular
proteins
notably
phospholipase
c
gamma

after
this
event
we
observed
a
rise
in
intracellular
ca2
concentration
corresponding
to
an

this
effect
required
surface

of
the
cd45
ptpase
and
was
not
observed
in

of

in
the

the
effect
of
pervanadate
on
tyrosine

was
globally
decreased
and
some
phosphorylated

were
specifically
missing
pervanadate
also
stimulated
transcription
of
the
c

and
accumulation
of
its

as
well
as
several
other
hallmarks
of

such
as

as

we
thus
conclude
that

play
a
crucial
role
in
the
negative

of
signal

culminating
in
t
lymphocyte

the

as

normal

were
analyzed
sr
patients
had
two
distinguishable
gr

15
of
the
17

and

this
defect
was
localized
to

and
reverted
to
normal
after
48

in
culture
media
however
incubation
with
a
combination
of
il

sustained
this
abnormality
the
other
two
sr

had
an
abnormally
low
gr

with

that
was
not

to
t

furthermore
gr

failed
to
normalize
after
incubation
in

alone
or
il

and
il

therefore
sr
asthma
may
be
due
to
more
than
one
abnormality
the
majority
related
to
a
reversible
cytokine
induced
reduction
in
gr

affinity
and
the
second
related
to
an
irreversible

in

these

may
have

nonsteroidal

the

conclusion
these

add
further

to

that
certain

may
be
associated
with

to
inquire
into
the

the

gcr
of
peripheral

in

was
determined
with

and
the
corresponding

were
assessed
with

the
results
showed
that
the

in

was
significantly
reduced
p

and
it
was
increased
when
their

was

however
it
was

in

p

the

increased
when

no
difference
in

was
found
between

these
results
indicate
that
the
function
of
adrenal
cortex
may
be
improved
by
the
compensation
mechanism
of
the
patients
but
the
lower
gcr
number
was
the
result
of
lacking
of
oxygen
in
the
patients
the
number
of
gcr
may
be
improved
by
inhalation
of
oxygen
therefore
oxygen
therapy
is
helpful
in
raising
the
activity
of
glucocorticoid
receptors
and
controlling
the
development
of
the

both

the
precise

of

in

in

have
not
been

here
we
have
studied

however
il

these
data
indicate
that
il

occurs
in
the
absence
of
of

but
is
comparatively
inefficient
these
findings
may
help
in
understanding
the
pathogenesis
of
the

that
occurs
with

of

may
suggest

using

we

furthermore

thus
we
focused
our

on

we
detected

we
next

furthermore

was
detected
only
in

our

indicated
that
in

immunopoiesis
occurring

p50
is

in

these

suggested
that

have
different
roles
in

alternative
mechanisms
include
the
possibility
that

or
that
other

carry
out
the

we

that
the

is
a

of

these
roi

can
to
a
large
extent
be
attributed
to
the

of

nf

now
we
have
examined
whether
naive

differ
in
their
sensitivity
to

when

naive

were
directly
stimulated
with

nf
kappab
nuclear

was
stronger
in

cells
than
in

and
it
could
be
induced
with
lower
doses
the
composition
of
the
induced
nuclear

levels
of
p50
and
rela

was
similar
in
these
cell
types
the
magnitude
and
kinetics
of
intracellular

were
similar
suggesting
that
there
were
no
differences
in

or
antioxidative

the
probable
regulatory
point
was
the
cytoplasmic
ikappab
inhibitor
in
cd45ra
cells
h2o2
caused
a
more
profound
depression
in
the
levels
of
ikappab

these
findings
indicate
that
t
cells
representing
different
activation
and
or
differentiation
stages
can
be
differentially
responsive
to
roi
mediated
signals
cells
need
to
distinguish
between
transient
ca2
signals
that
induce
events
such
as
muscle
contraction
secretion
adhesion
and
synaptic
transmission
and
sustained
ca2
signals
that
are
involved
in
cell
proliferation
and
differentiation
the
latter
class
of
events
is
blocked
in
lymphocytes
by
the
immunosuppressive
drugs
cyclosporin
a
and
fk506
which
inhibit
calcineurin
a
ca2
activated
serine
threonine
phosphatase
necessary
for
the
nuclear
import
of
nf
at
transcription
factors
here
we
report
that
sustained
high
concentrations
of
ca2
but
not
transient
pulses
are
required
to
maintain
nf
at
transcription
factors
in
the
nucleus
where
they
participate
in
ca2

induction
of

required
for

furthermore
overexpression
and
constitutive
nuclear

of

members
renders
the
interleukin

in

t

resistant
to

and
cyclosporin
a
thus
a
primary
effect
of
these
immunosuppressive
reagents
is
to
control
the
subcellular

of
the

after

i
kappa
b

is
rapidly
degraded
in

with

of

the
present

demonstrates
that
tumor

alpha
induced
degradation
of
i
kappa
b
alpha
in
human
t

is
preceded
by
its
rapid

in

however
these
effects
on
i
kappa
b
alpha
result
in
nuclear
mobilization
of
only
a
fraction
of
the
entire
cytoplasmic
pool
of

subsequent
studies
have
revealed
that
i
cytoplasmic
rela
is
stably
associated
not
only
with
i
kappa
b
alpha
but
also
with
other
ankyrin

rich
proteins
including
the
products
of
the

in

rela
p100
cytoplasmic

are
not
dissociated
following
tumor

alpha
activation
iii
p100
functions
as
a
potent
inhibitor
of
rela
mediated
transcription
in

iv
the
interaction
of
rela
and
p100
involves
the
conserved
rel
homology
domain
of
both
proteins
but
not
the
nuclear
localization
signal
of
rela
which
is
required
for
i
kappa
b
alpha
binding
v
p100
inhibition
of

requires
the

which
mediates

retention
of

and
vi
as
observed
with

b

nuclear

stimulates

these
findings
thus
reveal
the
presence
of
a

pathway
that
helps
ensure
the
rapid
but
transient

of

in

we
examined

further
we
measured

that
were

with

against

in

first
anti

did
not
affect

from
the

second
t
cells
which
lack
cd45
and
cannot
signal
via
the

supported
higher

this
was
due
to
the

in
the

additionally
infected

in

we
obtained

that

also
augments

we
also
found

by

currently

indicate
that

in

to

the

we
interbred

we
find
that
in

are
elevated
approximately

identifies

as

our
findings
are
compatible
with
a

in

the

defined

further
reduce

we
have

or

events
neither
of
which
would
be

by

we
have
studied
48
patients

seventeen
microsatellite

that
span
the

were
used
to

for

observed
in
a

of

granulocyte
dna
from
four
patients
exhibited
allele
loss
on

in
each
case
the

was
caused
by
an
interstitial

because
heterozygosity
at

was
retained
and
because
quantitative
southern

demonstrated
hemizygosity
loss
of

in

granulocytes
would
be
masked
by
the
presence
of
significant

of

granulocytes
not
derived
from
the

therefore
the
human
androgen

assay
humara
was
used
to
determine
granulocyte
clonality
in

of
27
informative
female
patients
the
majority
of
the
granulocytes
were
clonally
derived
in

patients
the
granulocytes
appeared
polyclonal
and
in
1
patient
unilateral

was
observed
in
both
granulocytes

these
results
show
that
in
the
vast
majority
of
patients
presented
here
the
failure
to
detect
loss
of
heterozygosity
cannot
be
attributed
to
the

polyclonal
granulocytes
our
results
therefore
show
that
allele

on
chromosome
20q
in
polycythemia

does
not
commonly
involve
mitotic

degree
in
the
extreme
susceptibility
of
the

to

and

and
may
even
participate
in
various
aspects
of

the
current
understanding
of
the
molecular
mechanisms
underlying
immunosenescence
is
still
fragmentary
the
most
extensively
studied
phenomenon
is
the
progressive
decline
in
the
proliferative
capacities
of
t
lymphocytes
with
aging
the
loss
of
proliferative
potential
in
response
to
antigenic
challenge
is
a
characteristic
feature
of
immune
senescence
it
is
directly
implicated
in
the
emergence
of
the
age
related
immune
deficiency
the
purpose
of
this
review
is
to
show
how
the
accumulation
of
various
biochemical
lesions
with
advancing
age
leads
to
the
failure
of
a
critical
cell
function
namely
the
activation
induced
lymphocyte
proliferation
the
biochemical
modifications
responsible
for
the
defect
in
transduction
and
execution
of
the
proliferative
signal
are
analyzed
as
a
function
of
age
the
multiple
alterations
observed
on
the
various
biochemical
pathways
may
appear
as
a
consequence
of
a
unique
deleterious
mechanism
more
fundamentally
related
to
the
process
of
senescence
such
as
the
inability
to
cope
with
oxidative
stress
engagement
of
surface
immunoglobulin
on
mature
b

leads
to
rescue
from
apoptosis
and
to

with

we
have
located
the
major
positive
regulatory
region
for
control
of
bcl

expression
in
b
cells
in
the
5
flanking
region
the
positive
region
can
be
divided
into
an
upstream
and
a
downstream
regulatory
region
the
downstream
regulatory
region
contains
a
cyclic
amp
responsive
element
cre
we
show
by
antibody
supershift

and
uv
cross

that
both

bind
to
this

in

mutations
of
the

that
result
in
loss
of
creb
binding
also
lead
to
loss
of
functional
activity
of
the
bcl

promoter
in
transient
transfection
assays
the
presence
of
an
active
cre
site
in
the
bcl

promoter
implies
that
the
regulation
of
bcl
2
expression
is
linked
to
a
signal
transduction
pathway
in
b

leads
to
an
increase
in

is

bcl
2
expression
is
increased
following
phorbol

treatment
and
the
increased

is
dependent
on
the
cre
site
these
stimuli
result
in
phosphorylation
of
creb
at
serine
133
the
phosphorylation
of
creb
that
results
in
activation
is
mediated
by
protein
kinase
c
rather
than
by
protein
kinase
a
although
the
cre
site
is
necessary
optimal
induction
of
bcl
2
expression
requires
participation
of
the
upstream
regulatory
element
suggesting
that
phosphorylation
of
creb
alters
its
interaction
with
the
upstream
regulatory
element
the
cre
site
in
the
bcl

appears
to
play
a
major
role
in
the
induction
of
bcl

expression
during
the
activation
of
mature
b

and
during
the
rescue
of
immature
b

from

it
is
possible
that
the
cre

is
responsible
for
induction
of
bcl

other

this

indicates
that

by

despite

the

by
which
these

exert
this

remains
to

therefore
we
have
studied
the

when

we
propose
that

at

a

the

demonstrate
that

analysis
of

the

however
the

approximately

that
deregulate
the

of

by
juxtaposing

to
the

the

encodes
a

containing
six
c

and
an

suggesting
that
it

function
as

by
using
a

selected
for
its

we

here
that
bcl

is
present
in
dna
binding
complexes
in
nuclear

from
various
b
cell
lines
in
transient

bcl6
can
repress
transcription
from
promoters
linked
to
its

target
sequence
and
this
activity
is
dependent
upon
specific
dna
binding
and
the
presence
of
an
intact

half
of
the

we
demonstrate
that
this
part
of
the
bcl6
molecule
contains
an
autonomous
transrepressor
domain
and
that
two
noncontiguous
regions
including
the

mediate
maximum
transrepressive
activity
these
results
indicate
that
the
bcl

can
function
as
a

transcriptional
repressor
and
have
implications
for
the

the

in

the

have
analysed
the

the

indicated
that
the

these

suggest
that

we

the

both

studies
on

unequivocally
indicate
that

it

these

that

the

by
its

we
previously
suggested
that
the

is
an
index
of
an

in

from

can
be
interpreted
as
a

also
significantly
decreased
from

we
suggest
that
in

are
initially
up
regulated
by
dexamethasone
and
then
down
regulated
while
in

an

cannot
be
achieved

suggested
by
the

three

interestingly

only
the

showed
a
dramatic
decrease
of

whereas
the

showed
only
a
slight

for
all
other

no
differences
in

were
detectable
the

r217a

caused
an
increased

efficiency
for

but
no
change
in

from
these
results
we
can
conclude
that
electrostatic
interactions
of
retinoids
with
the
rar

play
a
significant
role
in
ligand

in

understanding

in

epithelial

replication
within

and
viral

occurs
in

it
is
known
that

is
sufficient
to
initiate
the

in

cellular

is
therefore
thought
to

here
we

we

this

the

the

suggest
that

and
is

only
in

and
in

but
not

the
primary

transcript
of
the

is
subject
to
alternative
splicing
to
yield
different

which
can
either
activate

the

produced
in

have
a
predominantly

effect
on

whereas
those
produced
in

have
a

and
can
repress
the

of
both

thus
oct

plays
an
important

in
the

here
using

the

centered
at

this

quantitative

footprinting
of
the

demonstrated
that
the

two
other
previously
unrecognized

in

also
identified
by
this

thus
through
the
differential
use
of
the

the

the

is

that

in

activation
of

these

a

we
observed

using

we
investigated
the

involved
in
the

of

this
revealed
that

to

not
to

in

ap

these

suggest
that

can
stimulate

at

in

via

we

the

finally
it

this

demonstrates
that

demonstrated

furthermore
the

therefore
costimulation
by
alpha

beta

was
not
due
to

of

of

we
conclude
rather
that
alpha

beta

in
freshly

delivers
a
distinct

that
synergizes
early
with

initiated
by

ligation
to
induce

of
multiple

required
for

the
induction
of

requires
signals
from
the
tcr
and
a
co

molecule
such
as
cd28
that
activate
parallel

these

by

we
found
that
the

forskolin
inhibits

an

at

nevertheless

such

which
is
critical
for
the

process
of

to
further
analyze
potential
cross

between
positively

pathways
in

we
tested
the

both

our

suggest
that

in

in

the

rate
of
these

was
unchanged
in
comparison
with

in

inhibition
of

with

indicated
that
dox
induced
an
increased
stability
of
pbgd

gata

mrnas
whereas
acla
did
not
affect
the
half

of
these
mrnas
because
the
increase
in
erythroid
mrna
steady

level
in
anthracycline
treated

was
inhibited
by
cycloheximide
this
suggests
that
transcriptional
activation
in
acla

and
mrna
stabilization
in

were
dependent
on

finally

these

prompted

to

questioned
whether

thus
possibly
explained

neither

to
examine

we
studied
the
ability
of
three
prototype
stress
hormones
dexamethasone
a
synthetic
glucocorticoid
and
the
catecholamines
norepinephrine
and
epinephrine
to
alter
the

dexamethasone
inhibited

in

fashion
and
at

it
had
no

on

the
glucocorticoid

reduction
of

was
antagonized
by

a

suggesting
that
it
was

by

norepinephrine
and

also
suppressed
il

in
a

fashion
and
at
physiological

both
catecholamines
however
dose
dependently
increased
the

of
il

the

of
either
catecholamine
on

or
il

were
blocked
completely
by
propranolol
a
beta
adrenoreceptor
antagonist
indicating
that
they
were
mediated
by
the
beta

these
findings
suggest
that
the
central

may
regulate

il
10

and
hence
th1
th2
balance
via
the

effectors
of
the

thus
stress
may
cause
a
selective

of

and
a
shift
toward
a

cytokine
pattern
rather
than
generalized
th

the
th1

may
be
responsible
for
the

of

certain

through

a

finally
the

that

supported
by

also

the
combined

lend

to
the
proposal
that

initiate

that

however
more

that

is
not

that

thus
supporting
a

that

indeed

that

these

support
our
conclusion
that

how

and
whether

in

neither

these

in

we

t

that

alpha
a

and
activator

this
nonresponsiveness
occurs
because
of

these

therefore
as
t

progress
from

through

followed
by

their

that

on

il

enhanced
the

of

these
results
suggest
that

may
inhibit
the

of

by
affecting

while
il

may
inhibit
the

post

without
suppressing

therefore
we
conclude
that
il
4
and
il
10
inhibit
il

by
different
mechanisms
in
human
monocytic

the
mechanism
of

of

the

il

production
by

is
therefore
dramatically
reduced
we
demonstrate
here
however
that

can
be
activated
and
significant
levels
of
il

can
be
produced
by
the

in

assays
both

these

much
attention
has
recently
focused
on
the
observation
that

activate

of
the
human

hiv
although
the
mechanism

remains
obscure
several
lines
of

have
suggested
that
it
is
a
result
of

s
following

related
to

in
this

we
present
data
demonstrating
that
hiv
ltr

is
not
a
general
consequence
of
cellular
dna
damage
but
rather
a
process
unique
to
specific
genotoxic

and
that
it
does
not
necessarily
depend
on
activation
of

furthermore
we
demonstrate
that
several
of
these
agents
can
significantly
increase
hiv

and
accelerate

in

these
findings
therefore
could
have

the

the

demonstrate
that

this

to

it

that

furthermore
the

was
analyzed
by

it
was
found
that

suggest
that

the

is

prove
useful
as

in

there
may
be
a
disproportionate
severity
of
signs
and
symptoms
of
illness
compared
to
the
fraction
of
cd4
infected
t
lymphoid
cells
in
part
this
may
be
due
to
altered
intercellular
signalling
systems
and
intracellular
signal
transduction
glucocorticoids
are
well
known
for
their
effects
on
the
vitality
and
function
of
lymphoid
cells
patients
with
hiv
infections
often
show
elevated
circulating
levels
of
cortisol
suggesting
some
misfunction
in
the
regulatory
systems
that
maintain
the
levels
of
this
critical
hormone
at
the
cellular
level
it
is
known
that
both
acute
hiv
infection
and
glucocorticoids
can
cause
apoptotic
cell
death
in
thymic
lymphocytes
however
chronically
hiv
infected
cells
appear
to
be
resistant
to
glucocorticoid
evoked
cell
death
glucocorticoid
receptor

studies
on
patients
cells
have
shown
reduced
affinity
between
the
receptor

sites
and
test
steroids
in

chronically
hiv
infected
cells
of
the
lymphoid
cem
line
displayed
resistance
to
glucocorticoid
induced
apoptosis
these
cells
showed
reduced
numbers
of
binding
sites
with
little
alteration
in
apparent
affinity
between
ligand
and
receptor
thus
it
appears
that
there
may
often
be
malfunction
of
the
normal
glucocorticoid
response
in
hiv
infected
cells
probably
due
to
altered
interactions
between
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
and
its

such
alterations
may
have
clinical
consequences
including
the
possibility
of
a
relatively
longer

of

p45
subunit
of

contains
a

and
dimerizes
with
the

to

while

was
shown
to
be
restricted
to

megakaryocytes
and

in

we
found
in
this
study
that
p45

abundantly
transcribed
in
the

of

as

in

the

most
likely
to
be

p45

also

albeit
the

is
much
lower
than
that
of

hl

were
found
to
express

mrna
indicating
the
presence
of
genuine
nf

in
the

although
p45

is
transcribed
from
two
different

anf

and

in

p45

p45

the

and
g

are
thought
to
play

in
the

during

most

we

that

throughout

and
not

as

we

the

we

by

although
the

clear
in
the

we
demonstrate
that

is

that
is
already

interestingly
the

these

suggest
that

by

we
further
demonstrate
that

however
the

of

is
not

therefore
the

recent

however
it

how
this

in
this

we
provide
evidence
that

the

via
a

like
ikappabalpha

breakdown
of
ikappabbeta
in

either
by

or
by

of

at

despite
the
dual

of

consequently

therefore
the

the

direct

we
found
that

in

dexamethasone
was
a

the

this
work
aimed
to
ascertain
the
role
of
kappab
responsive
elements
of
the
human
immunodeficiency
virus
type
1
hiv
1
enhancer
not
only
in
early
initiation
but
also
in
long
term
maintenance
of
proviral
transcription
in
cells
of
the
monocytic
lineage
for
this
purpose
we
used
three
main
approaches
the
first
was
to
abruptly
terminate
tumor
necrosis
factor
induced
nf
kappab
binding
to
the
enhancer
sequences
in
u1
monocytic
cells
using
a
short
pulse
of
exogenous
tumor
necrosis
factor
this
resulted
in
concomitant
decrease
in
nuclear
nf
kappab
dna
binding
activity
and
endogenous
long
terminal
repeat
transcriptional
activity
the
second
was
to
suppress
the
permanent
nf
kappab
translocation
induced
by
hiv
1
replication
itself
in
chronically
infected
u937
cells
using
a
specific
proteasome
inhibitor
z
lll
h
as
early
as
2
h
after
addition
of
the
inhibitor
to
the
culture
medium
there
was
an
inhibition
of
both
constitutive
activation
of
nf
kappab
and
hiv
1
genome
expression
the
third
approach
was
to
monitor
the
replication
competence
in
u937
cells
of
an
infectious
hiv
1
provirus
carrying
point
mutations
in
the
kappab
responsive
elements
of
both
long
terminal
repeats
compared
with
its
wild
type
counterpart
this
mutated
provirus
showed
a
profoundly
decreased
z
lll
h
insensitive
transcriptional
and
replicative
activity
in
u937
monocytes
together
our
results
indicate
that
occupancy
of
the
viral
enhancer
by
nf
kappab
p50
p65
heterodimers
is
required
for
ongoing
transcription
of
integrated
hiv
provirus
in
monocytes
even
in
cells
chronically
infected
and
permanently
producing
functional
hiv
tat
protein
thus
the
ability
of
hiv
1
replication
to
activate
nf
kappab
is
crucial
to
the
intense
self
perpetuated
viral
transcription
observed
in

these
findings
establish
that

function
as

activator
or

of
gene
expression
and
is
required
by
t
lymphocytes
for

activation
of

requires
the
combined
signaling
of

such
as

the
ability
of

to
produce
interleukin

il

is
a
critical
control
point
in

the

motif
named
cd28

element
cd28re
that
serves
a
role
as
a

for
mitogenic

signals
the
cd28re
sequence
reveals
similarity
to
the

kappab

here
we
demonstrate
that
cd28re
binds
an
inducible
protein
with
a
molecular
mass
of
approximately
35
kda
called
nuclear

of
mitogenic
activated
t

nf

that
is
clearly
different
from
the
known
nf

members
induction
of

was
shown
to
depend
on

and
was
restricted
to

that
received

not
necessarily
including
cd28
signaling
nonmitogenic
t

did
not
result
in

of

these
results
indicate
that
mitogenic
combinations
of
t
cell
activation
signals
are
integrated
at
the
level
of
nf
matp35
induction
similar
to
its
effect
on
il

cyclosporin
a
inhibited
the

of

these
data
demonstrate
that
the
nuclear

of

shows
excellent
correlation
with
il

which
is
a
unique
characteristic
among

the

it

mainly
by
dimerizing
with

members
of
the

such

the

we

leads
to
the
prevention
of
chemotherapy
paclitaxel
induced
expression
of
fasl
and
blocks
paclitaxel

the
mechanism
of
this
effect
is
that
bcl

prevents
the
nuclear

of

nuclear

of

a

factor
activated
by

that

dephosphorylate
nfat
to
move
to

without

the

is
not

thus
it
appears
that
paclitaxel
and
other

that
disturb

kill

at

in

through

thrombopoietin
is
known
to
be
essential
for

and
thrombopoiesis
recently
we
and
others
have
shown
that
thrombopoietin
induces
rapid
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
jak2
and
other
proteins
in
human
platelets
and
baf3
cells
genetically
engineered
to
express
c
mpl
a
receptor
for
thrombopoietin
the
jak
family
of
tyrosine
kinases
are
known
to
mediate
some
of
the
effects
of
cytokines
or
hematopoietic
growth
factors
by
recruitment
and
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
a
variety
of
stat
signal
transducers
and
activators
of
transcription
proteins
hence
we
have
investigated
whether
stat
proteins
are
present
in
platelets
and
if
so
whether
they
become
tyrosine
phosphorylated
in
response
to
thrombopoietin
we
immunologically
identified

and
stat5
in
human

thrombopoietin
induced
tyrosine

also
induced
tyrosine

of
stat3
and
stat5
in
fdcp

cells
genetically
engineered
to

thus
our
data
indicate
that
stat3
and
stat5
may
be
involved
in
signal
transduction
after
ligand
binding
to
c

and
that
this
event
may
have
a
role
in
megakaryopoiesis
thrombopoiesis
or
possibly
a
mature

such
as

recent
studies
have
defined
genetic
alterations
commonly
associated
with
transformed
lymphocytes
this
review
suggests
roles
for
these
alterations
in
the
development
of
lymphoid
neoplasms
damage

the
genes
encoding
proteins
that
function
in
intracellular

transcription
or
regulation
of
the

cycle
has
been
identified
and
linked
at
varying
degrees
to
the
progression
of
certain
lymphoid
malignancies
an
understanding
of
the
mechanistic
consequences
following
such
genetic
alterations
is
essential
to
an
understanding
of
the
development
of
these
lymphoid
neoplasms
in
contrast
it
is
also
becoming
clear
that
the
dysregulated
expression
of
proteins
that
are
not
genetically
altered
can
also
contribute
to
the
progression
of
lymphoid
malignancies
one
such
example
is
the
excessive
expression
of
normal
lymphokines
of
cytokines
which
accompanies
many
lymphoproliferative
diseases
the
dysregulated
expression
of
cytokines
during
malignancy
can
result
in
the
augmentation
of
growth
of
transformed
lymphocytes
as
well
as
an
alteration
of
the
anti
tumor
immune
response
the
latter
mechanism
is
especially
important
because
evasion
of
the
impending
immune
response
is
a
prerequisite
for
the
progression
of
lymphoproliferative
diseases
taken
together
this
review
supports
the
notion
that
the
development
of
lymphoid
malignancies
is
multifactorial
involving
genetic
alterations
as
well
as

this

the

additional

our

we

similar

and
in

to

cellular

e1a

we

the

however
a

this

both

these

strongly

a

the

by

observation
that
the

associated
with

with

addition

these

that

in

tumorigenesis
classically
initiates
from
an

amplified

2418dela
233g
a

in

thus
both

to
the
other
the
dna
change
2418dela
is
considered
a
mutation
that
inactivated
one
brca1
allele
because
it
caused
a
frameshift
and
generation
of
a
premature
stop
codon
resulting
in
synthesis
of
a
truncated

as
evidenced
by
an

the

233g
a
does
not
result
in

and
is
considered

ivs1

is
a

brca1
change
that
occurs
in
the
last
nucleotide
of

sequence
for

critical
for

therefore
we
investigated
whether
ivs1

deleteriously
affected

and
thereby
inactivated

no

was

that

abnormally
disrupted

or
caused
the

of

thus
ivs1

is

indicated
that
mutational
inactivation
of

was
not

for

it
is
possible
that
the

may
be
functionally
inactivated
by
a

effected
through

to
address
the

to

we
have
generated
a

that
can
be

to

in

manner
in

the

differ

in

of

of

mthc
in
the

and
il

will
differentiate
into
cells
that
have
many
of
the
properties
of
macrophages
when
the
same
mthc
lines
are
exposed
to
tnf
alpha
in
combination
with
ifn
gamma
the
cells
instead
become
dc
the
differentiated
dc
are
potent
presenters
of
antigen
in
mixed
lymphocyte
reactions
and
of
soluble
antigen
to
specific

cell
lines
thus
cells
with
the
properties
of
both
macrophages
and
dc
can
be
derived
from
a
single
type
of
gm
csf
responsive
progenitor
cell
we
have
used
this
mthc
system
to
analyze
differences
in
gene
expression
as
the
cells
mature
along
the
dc
and
macrophage
pathways
a
distinctive
pattern
of
differentially
expressed
cdnas
is
evident
where
macrophage
specific
cdnas
are
homologous
to
genes
encoding
cytoskeletal
and
cell
surface
proteins
whereas
the
dc
specific
cdnas
are
homologous
to
signaling
chemokine
and
ifn
gamma
inducible
genes
we
discuss
the
utility
of
mthc
in
analyzing
the
relationships
between
dc
and
macrophages
and
suggest
that
dc
and
macrophages
represent
extreme
phenotypes
in
a
spectrum
of
antigen

that
are
somewhat
interchangeable

on
their

in
legionella
pneumophila
the
gene
encoding
the
homolog
of
the
escherichia
coli
stress
and
stationary
phase
sigma
factor
rpos
was
identified
by
complementation
of
an
e
coli
rpos
mutation
an
open
reading
frame
that
is
approximately
60
identical
to
the
e
coli
rpos
gene
was
identified
western
blot
analysis
showed
that
the
level
of
l
pneumophila
rpos
increased
in
stationary
phase
an
insertion
mutation
was
constructed
in
the
rpos
gene
on
the
chromosome
of
l
pneumophila
and
the
ability
of
this
mutant
strain
to
survive
various
stress
conditions
was
assayed
and
compared
with
results
for
the
wild
type
strain
both
the
mutant
and
wild
type
strains
were
more
resistant
to
stress
when
in
stationary
phase
than
when
in
the
logarithmic
phase
of
growth
this
finding
indicates
that
l
pneumophila
rpos
is
not
required
for
a
stationary
phase
dependent
resistance
to
stress
although
the
mutant
strain
was
able
to
kill
hl
60
and
thp
1
derived
macrophages
it
could
not
replicate
within
a
protozoan
host
acanthamoeba
castellanii
these
data
suggest
that
l
pneumophila
possesses
a
growth
phase
dependent
resistance
to
stress
that
is
independent
of
rpos
control
and
that
rpos
likely
regulates
genes
that
enable
it
to
survive
in
the
environment
within
protozoa
our
data
indicate
that
the
role
of
rpos
in
l
pneumophila
is
very
different
from
what
has
previously
been
reported
for
e
coli
rpos
it
is
generally
assumed
that
most
mammalian
genes
are
transcribed
from
both
alleles
hence
the
diploid
state
of
the
genome
offers
the
advantage
that
a
loss
of
function
mutation
in
one
allele
can
be
compensated
for
by
the
remaining
wild
type
allele
of
the
same
gene
indeed
the
vast
majority
of
human
disease
syndromes
and
engineered
mutations
in
the
mouse
genome
are
recessive
indicating
that
recessiveness
is
the
default
state
however
a
minority
of
genes
are
semi
dominant
as
heterozygous
loss
of
function
mutation
in
these
genes
leads
to
phenotypic
abnormalities
this
condition
known
as
haploinsufficiency
has
been
described
for
five
of
the
nine
mammalian
pax
genes
which
are
associated
with
mouse
developmental
mutants
and
human
disease
syndromes
recently
we
have
reported
that
the
pax5
gene
is
subject
to
allele
specific
regulation
during
b
cell
development
pax5
is
predominantly
transcribed
from
only
one
of
its
two
alleles
in
early
b
lymphoid
progenitors
and
mature
b
cells
while
it
transiently
switches
to
a
biallelic
mode
of
transcription
in
pre
b
and
immature
b
cells
as
a
consequence
b
lymphoid
tissues
are
mosaic
with
regard
to
the
transcribed
allele
and
heterozygous
mutation
of
pax5
therefore
results
in
deletion
of
b
lymphocytes
expressing
only
the
mutant
allele
the
allele
specific
regulation
of
pax5
raises
the
intriguing
possibility
that
monoallelic
expression
may
also
be
the
mechanism
causing
the
haploinsufficiency
of
other
pax
genes
in
this
review
we
discuss
different
models
accounting
for
the
haploinsufficiency
of
mammalian
pax
genes
provide
further
evidence
in
support
of
the
allele
specific
regulation
of
pax5
and
discuss
the
implication
of
these
findings
in
the
context
of
the
recent
literature
describing
the
stochastic
and
monoallelic
activation
of
other
hematopoietic
genes
we
have
investigated
mechanisms
and
consequences
of

by

show
that

that

however

however
have

the

also

in

a

had
no

significant

although
it

our
findings
support
the
notion
that
zap

can
be
direct
substrates
for
shp1
in

however
the
two
sh2
domains
of
shp1
did
not
facilitate
its
recognition
of
zap
70
and
syk
as
substrates
in
intact

therefore
we
suggest
that
shp1
is
not
actively
recruited
to
inhibit
tcr
signaling
induced
by
ligation
of
this
receptor
alone
instead
we
propose
that
ligation
of
a
distinct
inhibitory

leads
to
the
recruitment
of
shp1

its
sh2

of

we

furthermore

these

demonstrate

that

further

this

the
aim
of
this

was
to
examine
the
ability
of
tumor

alpha
tnfalpha
a
proinflammatory
cytokine
and
interleukin
il
10
an
anti

cytokine
to
differentially
regulate
the
sensitivity
of

monocytes
macrophages
to

to
accomplish
this
we
first
analyzed
the
pattern
of
tnfalpha
and
il
10
inhibition
by
dexamethasone
in
lps
stimulated
whole

cell
cultures
second
we
studied
the
modulation
of
the
sensitivity
of
these
cells
to
dexamethasone
by
preincubation
with
tnfalpha
or
il

and
measurement
of

in
addition
we
evaluated
the
effect
of
dexamethasone
on
phorbolmyristate

stimulated
il

receptor
antagonist
secretion
by
the
human
monocytic
cell
line
u937
finally
we
investigated
whether
the
modulation
of
corticosensitivity
in
tnfalpha
and
il
10
pretreated
u937
cells
was
related
to
a
change
of
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
concentration
and
affinity
dexamethasone
had
different
effects
on
lps
induced
tnfalpha
and
il
10
secretion
whereas
it
suppressed
tnfalpha
in
a
dose
dependent
fashion
its
effect
on
il
10
secretion
was
biphasic
producing
stimulation
at
lower
and
inhibition
at
higher
doses
the
concentration
of
lps
employed
influenced
the
effect
of
dexamethasone
on
il
10
secretion
p
0
001
pretreatment
with
tnfalpha
diminished
and
with
il
10
improved
the
ability
of

to
suppress
il
6
secretion
in
whole
blood
cell
cultures
p

for
both
and
to
enhance
il
1
receptor
antagonist
secretion
by

p
0
05
for
both
tnfalpha
decreased
p
0
001
while
il
10
increased
p
0
001
the
concentration
of
dexamethasone
binding
sites
in
these
cells
with
no
discernible
effect
on
their
binding
affinity
we
conclude
that
glucocorticoids
differentially
modulate
tnfalpha
and
il
10
secretion
by
human
monocytes
in
a
lps
dose
dependent
fashion
and
that
the
sensitivity
of
these
cells
to
glucocorticoids
is
altered
by
tnfalpha
or
il
10
pretreatment
tnfalpha
blocks
their
effects
whereas
il
10
acts
synergistically
with
glucocorticoids
this
is
accompanied
by
opposite
glucocorticoid
receptor
changes
respectively
opposing
and
favoring
glucocorticoid
actions
this
study
suggests
that
the
pattern
of
pro
antiinflammatory
cytokine
secretion
may
alter
the
response
of
patients
to

therapy

examined
when

was
delayed
however
even
the

eventually
underwent

stably

continued
to

these

are
consistent

we

our

however
relatively
few

target

have

to
better
clarify
the
molecular

of

action
we
set
out
to
characterize
genes
up
regulated
by
il
12
first
by
contrasting
il
12
and
ifn
alpha
inducible
genes
we
identified
several
genes
up
regulated
by
il

namely
mip
1alpha

il

and
ifn
regulatory

irf

irf

is
a
transcription
factor
regulated
by

that
is
also
essential
for

we
demonstrated
that
il
12
directly
up
regulates
irf

to
the
same
extent
as
ifn
alpha
in
normal
human
t
cells
and
in

cells
we
showed
that
il
12
had
a
direct
effect
on
irf

an
effect
not
mediated
indirectly
by
the
induction
of
ifn
gamma
production
furthermore
il
2
and
il
12
synergistically
induced
irf
1
whereas
ifn
alpha
and
il
12
did
not
the
participation
of
stat4
in
the
regulation
of
irf
1
was
demonstrated
in
two
ways
first
stat4
was
required
for
the
il
12
dependent
transactivation
of
an
irf
1
reporter
construct
and
second
stat4
binding
to
the
irf
1
promoter
was
shown
using
emsa
in
contrast
to
il
12
no
up
regulation
of
irf
1
was
found
in
il
4
stimulated
cells
and
il
4
did
not
block
il
12
dependent
up
regulation
of
irf
1
therefore
irf
1
may
be
an
important
contributor
to
il
12
signaling
and
we
speculate
that
the
defective
il
12
responses
seen
in
irf
1
mice
might
be
attributable
in
part
to
the
absence
of
this
transcription
factor
the
chromatin
structure
of
the
human
beta
globin
gene
locus
assumes
a
transcriptionally
active
conformation
in
erythroid

one
feature
of
this
chromatin
reorganization
is
the
formation
of
dnase
1
hypersensitive
sites
in
the
regions
of
active
globin
gene
promoters
this
reorganization
requires
the
globin
locus
control
region
and
is
associated
with
normal
expression
of
the
beta
like
globin
genes
to
determine
whether
it
is
possible
to
artificially
enhance
the
opening
of
the
chromatin
structure
of
a
minimal
beta
globin

we
placed
a

and

constructs
were
stably
transfected
into
murine
erythroleukemia

and

chromatin

and
gene

were
analyzed
the
hsfe
induced
an
area
of
enhanced
dnase
1
hypersensitivity
extending
from
the
transcriptional
start
site
to
300bp
of
the
artificial
promoter
and
significantly
increased
the
proportion
of
beta
globin
promoters
in
an
open
chromatin
configuration
this
remodeling
of
promoter
chromatin
structure
resulted
in
3
fold
increases
in
beta
globin
gene
transcription
and
induction
and
inhibited
long
term
beta

silencing
these
results
indicate
that
a
relatively
small
cis

element
is
able
to
enhance
remodeling
of

chromatin
structure
resulting
in
increased

the

but
little
is
known
about

following

therefore
we
studied
the

in

after

in

however
the
components
of

were
different
in

because
p50
is
part
of
the

induced
by
cd40
triggering
in
both

whereas
p65
was

in

although
the

only
in

these
results
suggest
that
the

in

differ
following

this

is
consistent
with

the

activates
a

although
erythroid

we
have

the

the

these

indicate
that
an

to

moreover
ba

apparently
express

still
difficult

do
clinicians
truly

how
it
works
even
with

as

it
is
not
clear
if
the

is

to

to

the

of

so
at

with

bring
into

the

as
well
as
the

of

of

on
which
efficacy
of

the
variability
of

even
to
the

suggests
that
these

are

more
heterogeneous
in

than
in

clinicians
are
only
just

it

the

also
improving

only
through

new

we

simultaneously
with

we
provide
formal

that
the

permit
its
stable
maintenance
in

this

thus
ikappab

offers

of

that

the

that

in

is

this
is
due
to
alternative

to
the

of

recent

have
suggested
that

is
conserved
in

and
that
a
progressive

of

may
take
place
during

it
now
remains
to
be
investigated
which
parameters
determine
the

of
the

and
possibly
restrict
its

after
subsequent
antigenic
challenges
to
address
this
question
we
took
advantage
of
a

we
found
a

the
mechanisms
by
which

are
unknown
we
demonstrate
here
that
beta
catenin
can
be
imported
into
the
nucleus
independently
of
lef
tcf
binding
and
it
may
also
be
exported
from

we
have
introduced
a

that
disrupts

this
delta19
beta

mutant
localizes

because
it
may
not
be
efficiently
sequestered
in

the
nuclear
localization
of

definitively
demonstrates
that
the
mechanisms
by
which
beta
catenin
localizes
in
the
nucleus
are
completely
independent
of
lef

beta

in

not
in

even
though
both

thus
localization
of
both

is
not
sufficient
for
activation
of

excess
beta

squelch

these

that

that

the

nf

in
the
pathogenesis
of

has
long
been
a
subject
of
controversy
we
used
an
adenoviral
technique
of
blocking
nf
kappab
through
overexpression
of
the
inhibitory
subunit
ikappabalpha
which
has
the
advantage
that
it
can
be
used
in
the
diseased
tissue
itself
with
90
of
the
synovial
macrophages
fibroblasts
and
t
cells
infected
we
found
that
the
spontaneous
production
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
and
other
pro
inflammatory
cytokines
is
nf
kappab
dependent
in
rheumatoid
synovial
tissue
in
contrast
to
the
main
anti
inflammatory
mediators
like
il
10
and
11
and
the
il

receptor
antagonist
of
even
more
interest
ikappabalpha

inhibited
the

of

while
not
affecting
their

inhibitor
blocking

in
the

thus
has
a
very
beneficial
profile
reducing
both
the

the

has
widespread
applicability
allowing
rapid
testing
of
the
effects
of

a
potential
therapeutic
target

either

in

itself
tnf
is
one
of

our

demonstrate
that
those

lacking
capability
to
form
metastatic
tumors
in

are
susceptible
to
tnf
induced
apoptosis
in

however
cell

with
high
metastatic

are
resistant
to

in

furthermore
the

cell

were
resistant
to
cytolytic
action
of
other
cytotoxic
proteins
secreted
by

our

showed
that
tnf

correlates
with
the

this
finding
may
provide
a
tool

the

the

of

can
be

by

simple

one
problem
in

methods
however
is
that
there
may
be
significant

to
determine
the

in

we
analyzed

from

relatively
young
18

we
found
that
the

were
distributed
even
more
widely
both
in

in

reported
with

methods
we
also
found
that
the
deviation
of

in

was
well
correlated
thus
we
conclude
that
appropriate
controls
from
the

such
as

in
the
case
of

should
always
be

if

that

these

functionally

a

in

during

overexpression
of

confers

to

these
observations
suggest
that
a
high

in

is
incompatible
with
differentiation
in
this
study
each
of

was
constitutively
overexpressed

express

which
is
downregulated
as
a

to

along

we
now
demonstrate
that
a
forced
exogenous
expression
of
the
four
different
isoforms
of
wt1
in
k562
does
not
affect
the
differentiation

as
judged
by

we
conclude
that

of

is
not
a
prerequisite
for

these

in

we

that

the

in

but
very

this
shows
that
the

together
these

indicate
that
uv

cyp1a1

expression
in
mammalian

is
mediated
by
an
ah

formed
from

thus
the
photoproducts
of

are
suggested
to
be
mediators
of

via

to
the
ah

and
as
such
also
could
have
a
role
in

biological

here
we
show
that
the

determining

ikaros

aiolos
can
function
as
strong
transcriptional
repressors
this
function
is
mediated
through
two

domains
and
is
dependent
upon
the

context
and
cell

repression

ikaros

thus

these

suggest
that

overall
therefore
exposure
to
nsaids
leads
to
a

in

with

of

kappab
has
been
shown
to
have
both
proapoptotic
and
antiapoptotic
functions
in
t
cell
hybridomas
both
t
cell
activators
and
glucocorticoids
induce
apoptosis
here
we
show
that
blockade
of
nf
kappab
activity
using
a
dominant
negative
ikappabalpha
has
opposite
effects
on
these
two
apoptotic
signals
treatment
with
pma
plus
ionomycin
p
i
results
in
the
upregulation
of
fas
ligand
fasl
and
induction
of
apoptosis
inhibition
of
nf
kappab
activity
inhibits
the
p
i
mediated
induction
of
fasl
mrna
and
decreases
the
level
of
apoptosis
in
these
cultures
thus
establishing
nf
kappab
as
a
proapoptotic
factor
in
this
context
conversely
inhibition
of
nf
kappab
confers
a
tenfold
increase
in
glucocorticoid
mediated
apoptosis
establishing
that
nf
kappab
also
functions
as
an
antiapoptotic
factor
we
conclude
that
nf
kappab
is
a
context
dependent
apoptosis
regulator
our
data
suggests
that
nf
kappab
may
function
as
an
antiapoptotic
factor
in
thymocytes
while
functioning
as
a
proapoptotic
factor
in
mature
peripheral
t
cells
members
of
the
recently
discovered
socs
cis

family
have
been
proposed
as
regulators
of

and
while
targets
and
mechanisms
have
been
suggested
for
some
family
members
the
precise
role
of
these
proteins
remains
to
be
defined
to
date
no
socs
proteins
have
been
specifically
implicated
in
interleukin

signaling
in

here
we
report
socs

expression
in
response
to
il

in
both
t
cell
lines
and
human
peripheral

socs

protein
was
detectable
as
early
as
30
min
following
il

stimulation
while

seen
only
at
low
levels
after
2

unlike
cis
socs
3
was
rapidly
tyrosine
phosphorylated
in
response
to
il

tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
socs
3
was
observed
upon
coexpression
with
jak1
and
jak2
but
only
weakly
with
jak3
in
these
experiments
socs
3
associated
with
jak1
and
inhibited
jak1
phosphorylation
and
this
inhibition
was
markedly
enhanced
by
the
presence
of
il
2
receptor
beta
chain
il
2rbeta
moreover
following
il
2
stimulation
of
t
cells
socs
3
was
able
to
interact
with
the
il

receptor
complex
and
in
particular
tyrosine
phosphorylated
jak1
and
il
2rbeta
additionally
in
lymphocytes
expressing
socs
3
but
not
cis
il
2
induced
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
stat5b
was
markedly
reduced
while
there
was
only
a
weak
effect
on
il
3
mediated
stat5b
tyrosine
phosphorylation
finally
proliferation
induced
by
both
il
2
and
il
3
was
significantly
inhibited
in
the
presence
of
socs

the
findings
suggest
that
when
socs
3
is
rapidly
induced
by
il
2
in
t
cells
it
acts
to
inhibit
il
2
responses
in
a
classical
negative

loop
although
many
functions
of
human
alveolar

are
altered
compared

the
reason

for

to
determine
why
alveolar

do
not
express
ap

dna
binding
activity
we
first
showed
that
there
was
not
a
decrease
in
expression
of
the
fos
and
jun
proteins
that
make
up
the
ap

complex
there
was
however
a
significant
difference
in
the
amounts
of
the
nuclear
protein
ref

which
regulates
ap

dna
binding
by
altering
the
redox
status
of
fos
and
jun
proteins
in
alveolar
macrophages
compared
with
monocytes
in
addition
in

differentiation
of
monocytes
to
a
macrophage
like
cell
resulted
in
decreased
amounts
of
ref

finally
addition
of
ref

from
activated
monocytes
to
alveolar
macrophage
nuclear
proteins
resulted
in
a
marked
increase
in
ap

dna
binding
these
studies
strongly
suggest
that
the
process
of
differentiation
of
monocytes
into
alveolar
macrophages
is
associated
with
a
loss
of
ref
1
and
ap

activity
this
observation
may
explain
in
part
some
of
the
functional
differences
observed
for
alveolar

compared
with

the

the

to

additional

the

cd28
has
a

and
is
expressed
on

and
some

although
cd28
is
constitutively

its

is
transiently
down
regulated
following

cell
activation
and
declines
progressively
with
in

in

cd8
t

and
less
frequently
cd4
t
cells
may
completely
lose
cd28
surface
expression
during
chronic
infections
and
with

this
correlates
with
changes
of
nuclear
protein
binding
activities
to
two
motifs
site
alpha
and
beta
within
the
cd28
minimal
promoter
both
alpha
and
beta
bound
complexes
are
found
only
in
lymphoid
tissues
in
cd28
t
cells
and
in
some
transformed
b

these
complexes
are
coordinately
expressed
except
during
replicative
senescence
which
is
characterized
by
the
down
modulation
of
site
beta
but
not
site
alpha

activities
in

t

induces
a

in
both

cd4

cd8
t

differ
in
their

we
recently
developed
an

in
which
nuclear

of

can
be
reconstituted
in

with

and
the

we
have
now
used
this

to
identify
another

after

of

with
a

that
cannot
hydrolyze
gtp
ranq69l

supports

the

of

association
of

was
reconstituted
in

by

and
reconstitution
we
showed
that
ranbp1
restores
nuclear
export
after
the
ranq69l
preincubation
it
also
stimulates
nuclear
export
in
cells
that
have
not
been
preincubated
with
ranq69l
ranbp1
as
well
as
ran
binding
domains
of
the
cytoplasmic
nucleoporin
ranbp2
promote
the
release
of
crm1
from
the
npc
taken
together
our
results
indicate
that
rangtp
is
important
for
the
targeting
of
export
complexes
to
the
cytoplasmic
side
of
the
npc
and
that
ranbp1
and
probably
ranbp2
are
involved
in
the
dissociation
of
nuclear
export
complexes
from
the
npc
in
a
terminal
step
of

the

with

the

of

this

leads
to

of
the

the

are
not
well
understood
in
a
model
where

were
cocultured
with

we
observed
that

were
capable
of
efficiently

their

only
if
the

overexpressed
the
oncogene
c
myc
or
e1a
both
the
parental

the
oncogene
expressing

similarly
triggered
phosphoinositide
hydrolysis
in
the

cells
demonstrating
that
nk
cells
were
cytolytically
activated
in
contact
with
both
resistant
parental
and
oncogene
expressing
sensitive

the
cell
death
was
independent
of

p53
and
was
not
inhibited
by
an

these
results
provided
evidence
that
c
myc
and
e1a
activated
the
nk

induced
cytolysis
at
a
post

stage
of
nk

in

the

and
e1a
overexpressing
fibroblasts
were
more
sensitive
to
the
cytolytic
effects
of
isolated

cell
derived
granules
than
parental

the
data
indicate
that
oncogenes
activate
the
cytotoxicity
of
nk

this
mechanism
can
have
a
role
in
directing
the

of

this

the

thus
the

however
the

the

in

we

that

is
modulated
by

in

in

by

and
vanadate

found
to
strongly

with

moreover

present
data
suggest
that
h2o2
and

are
likely
to
inhibit
the

s
leading
to
enhanced
stat3

and
hence
its

these

demonstrate
that
the

can
be
modulated
by

and
provide

to

the

in

we

with

emphasis
on

of

in

to
increasing
our
understanding
of
the

that
regulate

these

have
suggested
novel

of

to
understand
the

analysis

demonstrated
that

the

these

point
out
the

in

by
either
regulating

in

an

was
decreased
when
the

whereas
this
was
not
the
case
when

furthermore
nfkappab

was
higher
after

than
on

interestingly
an

was
observed
in

altogether
these

indicate
that
the

depends
on
the

in

we
identified

our

demonstrated
that

and
presumably
other

is
primarily
regulated
by

the

plays

however
a

for

has
not
been

we
provide
evidence
here
that

express

that
can
be

by

and
a

of

in
addition
we
demonstrate
that

may
be
required
for

these

offer
insight
into
a

for

in

in

and
suggest
that

be

using

we
show
that
the

is

mainly
at
the

and
that

using

we
demonstrate
that

these

from
these

we
conclude
that
a

these

proposes
a

favours
a

the

encode

which
through
a

we

is
a

protein
in

it
acts
as
a

in
the

of

the
cofactor
for

hydroxylases
in
the

it
functions
as
a

cofactor
of

and
increases
the

of
hnf1
to
deepen
our
understanding
of
this
protein
we
characterized
its
expression
in
human

and

human

was

predominantly
in

with
significant

in

it
was
expressed
in

of
the

that
were
examined
importantly
it
was
also
present
in
the
nucleus
of

cells
which
lack

and
in
the

of

that
have
little
or
no

the

of
human
pcd

in
the

and
nonhepatic

was
compared
at
both

although
the

in

was
only
fourfold
higher
than
that
in

the

was
20

higher
than
that
in

than
the

in

transcription
and
translation
analysis
showed
that
the
longer
5

resulted
in
about
a

in

these
data
show
that
human
pcd
dcoh
is
not
only
present
in
cells
where
tetrahydrobiopterin
is
synthesized
or
hnf1
is
present
but
is
a
widely
distributed

its
differential

in

is

not

at
the
transcriptional

but
also
at
the
translational

the
maintenance
of
lymphocyte

by

is
a
critical
regulatory
mechanism
in
the

the
transcription

nf

has
been
shown
to
play
a
role
in
protecting
cells
against

we
show
here
that

also
has
a
role
in
regulating

transfection
of

reciprocally
inhibition
of
nf

activation
by
a

inhibitor
or
a

form
of
the

ikappab
makes
the

more
susceptible
to

furthermore
inhibition
of
nf

activation
by
a

inhibitor
rendered
a

hybridoma
more
susceptible
to

correspondingly
transfection
of

provided
considerable
protection
from

these
observations
were
corroborated
by

on

in

concanavalin
a

blasts
from

that

have
increased

associated
with

in

a

renders
the

in
summary
our
results
provide
compelling
evidence
that
nf
kappab
protects
against
fas
mediated

and
is
likely
to
be
an
important
regulator
of
t
cell

and

much
of
our
focus
in
understanding
th1
th2
development
has
been
on
the
signals
delivered
by
il

and
il

as
final
determinants
of
terminal
t
cell
differentiation
because
extinction
of
il

in
early
th2
development
could
potentially
be
important
in
imprinting
a
more
permanent
th2

on
a
population
of
t
cells
we
have
also
examined
various
parameters
regulating
the
il
12
signaling
pathway
whereas
il
4
appears
to
repress
functional
il
12
signaling
through
inhibition
of
il
12r
beta

expression
ifn
gamma
in
the
mouse
and
ifn
alpha
in
the
human
appear
to
induce
il
12r
beta

expression
and
promote
il
12
responsiveness
we
propose
that
th1
development
can
be
considered
in
two
stages
capacitance
and
development
capacitance
would
simply
involve
expression
of
il
12r
beta
1
and
beta
2
subunits
regulated
by
tcr
il

and
ifns
the
second
stage
development
we
propose
is
the
true
il
12
induced
developmental
stage
involving
expression
of
stat4
inducible
proteins
in
the
human
this
may
also
occur
via
ifn
alpha
which
is
able
to
activate
stat4
it
is
perhaps
possible
that
all
of
stat4
actions
on
th1
development
may
be
exert
directly
by
stat4
at
the
ifn
gamma
gene
however
we
suggest
that
more
likely
stat4
may
act
to
induce
th1
development
through
the
induction
of
other
non

genes
whose
stable

followed

of

selective

of

at
the

is
achieved
by

between

including

in
the

chain
and
the

of

we
demonstrate
that
in
addition
to
stat1alpha
stat3
is
also
activated
by
ifn
gamma
in
human
neutrophils
the
activation
of

was
not
found
in

although

was
also
observed
in

that
are

these
results
indicate
that
a

can
activate
different

members
in
a

specific
manner
which
might
result
in
cell

the

is
synthesized
in
three
prominent

these
differ
in
the

of

and

due
to
a
switch
from
the

to
modulate
the

of

recently
it
has
been
demonstrated
that
they
can
regulate

of

of

tnf
alpha

induction
of

has
been
well
characterized
in

we
investigated
whether

could
interfere
with
tnf
alpha

of
the

this

supporting
the
hypothesis
that

together
these

demonstrate
that

the

leading

to

a

of

that

we

here
we

are
inefficiently
induced
in

compared
to

in
addition
we
demonstrate
that
the
inducible
transcriptional
activity
of
the

is
abolished
by
specific
inhibitors
of

thus
we
could
trace
the

of
the

to
an
inefficient

evidencing
a
relevant
role
for
nf

in
the

of

in

furthermore
our

suggest
that
the

of

versus

expression
is
differentially
sensitive
to

however

proteasome

in
these

using

revealed
a
significant
age
related
decline
in

these
results
suggest
that
a
decline
in

results
in
a
failure
to
fully
degrade
ikappabalpha
in
the

this
failure

may
underlie
both
the

although

fludarabine
is
also
a

with

thus
it

here
we

fludarabine

brief

the

its

activation
of

requires
binding
of
at

three
distinct

and
nf
y
it
is
known
that
the
stability
of
this

results
from
cooperative

between

we
show
here
that
expression
of
ciita
in
mhc

triggers
occupation
of
the
promoters
by
these

this
observation
raised
the
possibility
that
the
effect
of
ciita
on
promoter
occupation
is
mediated
by
an
effect
on
the
cooperative
stabilization
of
the
dna
bound
multi

complexes
we
show
however
that
the
presence
of

does
not
affect
the
stability
of
the
higher

protein
complex
formed
on

by
rfx

and
nf

this
suggests
other
mechanisms
for
ciita
induced
promoter
occupancy
such
as
an
effect
on

leading
to
increased

of
mhc

this
ability
of
ciita
to
facilitate

occupation
is
undissociable
from
its
transactivation
potential
finally
we
conclude
that
this
effect
of
ciita
is

this

is
similar
to
that
previously
described
by

for

that

furthermore
we
show
that
whereas
the
expression
of
the

protein
aml1
mds1
evi1
completely
abrogates
the
growth
inhibitory
effect
of

and
allows

to
proliferate
expression
of

mds1
evi1
has
the
opposite
effect
and
it
strengthens
the
response
of
cells
to
the
growth
inhibitory
effect
of
tgf
beta1
by
using
the

we
also
show
that

and
aml1
mds1
evi1
physically
interacts
with
smad3
which
is
an

of

finally
we
have
correlated
the
response
of
the
cells
to
g
csf
or
tgf
beta1
with
the
ability
of
the
normal
and
fusion
proteins
to
activate
or
repress
promoters
which
they
can
directly
regulate
by
binding
to
the

site
we
propose
that
mutations
of
mds1
evi1
either
by
gene
truncation
resulting
in
the
transcription
repressor
evi1
or
by
gene
fusion
to

lead
to
an

of

here
we
report
that

thus

in

in

in

this
is

that

this

demonstrates
that

cause
transcription

transcription

surface

of
different
endothelial

which
leads
to
a

neutrophil

in
the
present
study
we
have
investigated
the
effect
of
glucocorticoid
hormones
on
neutrophil

tumor
cell
cytostasis
and
found
that
hydrocortisone
and
a
synthetic

dexamethasone
dex
inhibited
cytostasis
in
the
presence
or
absence
of
tumor
necrosis
factor
alpha
the
effect
of
dex
was
completely
reversed
by
a
glucocorticoid
receptor
antagonist
ru38486
to
clarify
the
underlying
mechanisms
we
examined
effects
of
dex
on
the
binding
avidity
of
beta2
integrin
on
the
neutrophil
surface
and
how
these
might
in
turn
affect
neutrophil

dex
was
found
to
inhibit
these
neutrophil
properties
and
ru38486
completely
suppressed
both

of

inhibition
taken
together
our
findings
suggest
that
glucocorticoid
hormone
inhibition
of
neutrophil
mediated
tumor
cell
cytostasis
is
at
least
partially
due
to
a
lowering
of
the
ligand

of

on
the

cytokine

on

and

often

the

of

stats
so
stat

pathways
are
candidates
for
influencing

we
reasoned
that

and

itself
in

epithelial
cells
provides
a
basis
for
detecting
cytokine
signaling
abnormalities
in
inflammatory
airway
disease
on
the
basis
of
nuclear
localization
and
phosphorylation
we
found
that
epithelial
stat1
but
not
other
control
transcription
factors
was
invariably
activated
in
asthmatic
compared
with
normal
control
or
chronic

subjects
furthermore
epithelial
levels
of

stat1
correlated
with
levels
of

for

icam

irf

and
stat1
and
in

icam

levels
correlated
with

in

however
only
low
levels
of
ifn

or
ifn

were
detected
in

in
all

the
results
therefore
provide
initial
evidence
linking
abnormal
behavior
of
stat

for
cytokine

to
the
development
of
an
inflammatory

in
that

the

also
change
the

the
use

the

a
major
cellular

moreover
ang

this

human
myeloid
differentiation
is
accompanied
by
a
decrease
in
cell
proliferation
because
the
translation
rate
is
an
important
determinant
of
cell
proliferation
we
have
investigated
translation
initiation
during
human
myeloid
cell
differentiation
using
the
hl
60
promyelocytic
leukemia
cell
line
and
the
u

monoblastic
cell
line
a
decrease
in
the
translation
rate
is
observed
when
the
cells
are
induced
to
differentiate
along
the
monocytic
macrophage
pathway
or
along
the
granulocytic

the

in

in

these

provide
evidence
for

somatic
hypermutation
is
the

mechanism
underlying
the

although

during

it
remains
a
matter
of
debate
whether
the

machinery
also
targets
non

we
have
studied
mutations
in
the

in

we

most

suggesting
they
were
not

in

but
may
like
ig
mutation
represent
an
inherent
feature
of
the

therefore
we
investigated
their

the

the
results
show

we
have
applied

to
the

of

this
approach
uses
monoclonal

that
distinguish

of

it
enables
rapid

quantitative

of

phosphorylation
on
a
discrete
cell
basis
and
is
both
more
sensitive
and
less
time
consuming
than
immunoblotting
furthermore
it
allows
for
discrimination
between
a
mixture
of
cells
that
differ
in
their
response
to
interferon
gamma
this
approach
should
allow
for
the
evaluation
of
different
intracellular

pathways
using
a
combination
of
monoclonal

that
are
specific
for

application
of
this
form
of

should
prove
valuable
in

in
addition
this

should
permit
dissection
of

lipopolysaccharide
induces
synthesis
and

of
the
85
kda
cytosolic
phospholipase
a2
this
enzyme
releases
arachidonic
acid
and
lyso
phospholipids
from
membranes
which
are
metabolized
to
eicosanoids
and
platelet

these
lipid
mediators
increase

of
transcription
factors
and
expression
of
cytokine
genes
indicating
a
function
for
cytosolic
phospholipase
a2
in
signal

and
inflammation
we
have
shown
previously
that
trifluoromethylketone
inhibitors
of

a2
suppressed

in

peripheral

mononuclear
leukocytes
in
this
study
the
subcellular
mechanisms
were
analyzed
by
which
trifluoromethylketones
interfere
with
gene
expression
we
found
that
they
reduced
the
initial
interleukin
1beta
mrna
transcription
rate
through
prevention
of
degradation
of
inhibitor
kappab
alpha
consequently
cytosolic
activation
nuclear

and
dna
binding
of
nuclear

kappab
were
decreased
trifluoromethylketones
ameliorate
chronic

in

thus
this
therapeutic
potency
may
reside
in
retention
of

in
the

expression
in
this
tumor
to
continue
our
investigation
of
the
cellular
events
that
occur
following
human
cmv
hcmv
infection
we
focused
on
the
regulation
of
cellular
activation
following
viral
binding
to
human
monocytes
first
we
showed
that
viral
binding
induced
a
number
of
immunoregulatory
genes
il
1beta
a20
nf
kappab
p105
p50
and
ikappabalpha
in
unactivated
monocytes
and
that
neutralizing
abs
to
the
major
hcmv
glycoproteins
gb
ul55
and
gh
ul75
inhibited
the
induction
of
these
genes
next
we
demonstrated
that
these
viral
ligands
directly
up
regulated
monocyte
gene
expression
upon
their
binding
to
their
appropriate
cellular
receptors
we
then
investigated
if
hcmv
binding
also
resulted
in
the
translation
and
secretion
of
cytokines
our
results
showed
that
hcmv
binding
to
monocytes
resulted
in
the
production
and
release
of
il
1beta
protein
because
these
induced
gene
products
have
nf
kappab
sites
in
their
promoter
regions
we
next
examined
whether
there
was
an
up
regulation
of
nuclear
nf
kappab
levels
these
experiments
showed
that
in
fact
nf
kappab
was
translocated
to
the
nucleus
following
viral
binding
or
purified
viral
ligand
binding
changes
in
ikappabalpha
levels
correlated
with
the
changes
in
nf
kappab
translocation
lastly
we
demonstrated
that
p38
kinase
activity
played
a
central
role
in
il
1beta
production
and
that
it
was
rapidly
up
regulated
following
infection
these
results
support
our
hypothesis
that
hcmv
initiates
a
signal
transduction
pathway
that
leads
to
monocyte
activation
and
pinpoints
a
potential
mechanism
whereby
hcmv
infection
of
monocytes
can
result
in
profound
pathogenesis
especially
in
chronic
inflammatory
type
conditions

previous

that
when

however
the

was
unknown
in

of

that

can
transactivate

when

was
identified
in

in

comparative
studies
showed
that

was
also
able
to
transactivate

to
a
lesser
extent
the

immunoblot
analysis
identified
fli

protein
in

derived
from

in

expression
of

was
identified
immunohistochemically
in
megakaryocytes
derived
from
cd34
cells
treated
with
the
megakaryocyte
differentiation
and
proliferation
factor
thrombopoietin
these
results
suggest
that
fli
1
is
likely
to
regulate
lineage
specific
genes
during
megakaryocytopoiesis
according
to
current
models
the

capacity
of
i
kappa

alpha
would
be
mediated
through
the
retention
of
rel

in

however
i
kappa

alpha
has
also
been
detected
in
the

of

and
when
overexpressed
by

to
gain
better
insight
into
the
potential

of

in
a
physiological
context
we
have
analysed
its

in

pbl
we
demonstrate
the

of

in

by

western

low
levels
of
nuclear
i
kappa
b
alpha
were
detected
in
resting
cells
whereas
a
superinduction
was
obtained
after
pma

the
nuclear
pool
of
i

alpha
showed
a
higher
stability
than
cytosolic
i
kappa
b
alpha
and
was
partially
independent
of
the
resynthesis
of
the

unexpectedly
the
presence
of
nuclear
i
kappa
b
alpha
did
not
inhibit
nf
kappab
binding
to
dna
and
this
phenomenon
was
not
due
to
the
presence
of
ikappabbeta
at
the
nuclear
level
immunoprecipitation
experiments
failed
to
demonstrate
an
association
between
nuclear
i
kappa
b
alpha
and
nf

proteins
our
results
demonstrate
that
in
resting
and
pma
activated
human
pbl
i
kappa
b
alpha
is
present
in
the
nucleus
in
an
apparently
inactive
form
unable
to
disrupt
nf

binding
from

we
introduce
a
new
experimental

combining

ftoc
this

allowed

and
to
study
the

defects
occurring
when

is
inhibited
during

fetal

infected
with

were
found
to
develop
normally
until

while

however

in

than
in

these
results
suggest
that

plays
a
crucial
role
in
ensuring
the
differentiation
and
survival
of

in
the
early

of

the
main
aims
of
this
work
were
to
examine
in

the

between

and
the

and
the

of
these

with

platelets
from

women
in

the

were
determined
by

highly

in

and

no

were
observed
for
these
variables
with

we
conclude
the
feca2
and
the
vmax
of
the

are
reliable
indicators
of
ca2

in
platelets
from
women
however
in

unlike
previous
observations
in

these
platelet

are
not
correlated
with

however
the

caused
by

is
poorly
understood
we
utilized
cocl2
as
a
mimetic

for

to
study

we
found
that

also
caused

led
to

additionally

caused
a

increase
in
the
rate
of

the

both

inhibited
by

a
our

suggests
that

directing

involve

while

these

results
we
show
that

initiated
a

that
resulted
in

conclusion
these

indicate
that

these

indicated

in

and
that
the

suggesting
that
an

our

provide
insight
into
the
biological

of

in

and
also
its

in

in
the
present

we
utilized

and

to
determine
how
ra
overcomes
the
dominant
negative

of
the
truncated

in
these
different
myeloid

unexpectedly
we
observed
that
an
rxr
specific
rather
than
an
rar
specific
agonist
induces
terminal
granulocytic
differentiation
of
mpro
promyelocytes
and
this
differentiation
is
associated
with
activation
of
dna
response
elements
corresponding
to
rar
rxr
heterodimers
rather
than
rxr
rxr
homodimers
this
rxr

activity
is
blocked
by

suggesting
extensive
cross

between
the
partners
of
the

heterodimer
in
contrast
in
the
more
immature

we
observed
that
this

is
inactive
either
in
potentiating

or
in

in

indicates
that
the

harbor

however
the

trichostatin
a
readily
activates
an

rar
reporter
construct
in
the

but
not
in
the

promyelocytes
indicating
that
differences
in
hdac
containing
repressor
complexes
in
these
two
closely
related
but
distinct
hematopoietic
lineages
might
account
for
the
differential

of
the

that
we

at

the

is
greatly
augmented
when

are
activated
by
the

of
il

although

are
largely
unresponsive
to

without

a

is
strongly
activated
by
the
combination
of
il

in
this

we
show
that
the
functional
synergy
between
il

and
il

in
cd8

correlates
with
the
activation
of

but
not
with
the
activation
of
the

the
functional
synergy
between
il

and
il

is
also
associated
with
a
prominent
increase
in
stat1
and
stat3
serine

over
that
observed
with
il
12
or
il

alone
by
contrast
stat

is
not
augmented
over
that
seen
with
either

a

of

completely
inhibits
the
serine
phosphorylation
of
stat1
and

induced
by
il

and
il

and
abrogates
the
functional
synergy
between
il
12
and
il

without
affecting
stat

this
suggests
that
p38

may
play
an
important
role
in
regulating
stat
serine
phosphorylation
in
response
to
the
combination
of
il

furthermore
these
findings
indicate
that
the
optimal
activation
of

by

may
depend
on
an

this

the

to
then

however
the

to
these

is
not
merely
governed
by
the
expression
of
their

and
the
availability
of

to

recent
studies
from
our

suggested
that
the
actions
of

and

on
myelopoiesis
also
are
influenced
by
endogenous

involving

in
this

we
examined
the
influence
of

on
the

quantitative

showed
that

neither

generated
significant

confirmed
that

of

conversion

was

within

when

were
treated
with
either
all
trans

or

at
doses
that
induce
their

toward

respectively
similarly
d3

of
normal

was
associated
with
increased

to
generate

from

when

were
exposed
to

they
became

of

data
presented
provide
further
evidence
for
the
local
modulation
of
myelopoiesis
by
intracrine
mechanisms
in
particular
our
findings
suggest
that
local

of

by

well
as

influences
their

traf2

molecule
which

cytoplasmic

we
have
found
that
it
is
phosphorylated
predominantly
on

residues
when
transiently
overexpressed
in

the
phosphorylation
appears
to
be
related
to
the
signaling
events
that
are
activated
by
traf2
under
these
circumstances
since
two
nonfunctional
mutants
were
found
to
be
phosphorylated
significantly
less
than
the
wild

protein
furthermore
the
phosphorylation
status
of
traf2
had
significant
effects
on
the
ability
of
the
protein
to
bind
to
cd40
as
evidenced
by
our
observations
that
the
cd40
cytoplasmic
domain
interacted
preferentially
with
underphosphorylated
traf2
and
that
phosphatase
treatment
significantly
enhanced
the
binding
of
traf2
to
cd40
we
conclude
from
these
studies
that
the
phosphorylation
of
traf2
is
likely
to
play
an
important
role
in
regulating
signaling
by
virtue
of

the

the

we

dp1

e2f4
as
b

progressed
from

this
increase

was
attributable
to
dephosphorylation
as

convert
the

we
further

our

the

we
observed

this

we
realized
that

neither

produced
a

of

this
observation
was

confirmed
in

this
different

may
be
at

in
part
due
to
the
ability
of
htb
and
triflusal
to
block
the
activation
of
the
transcription

nuclear

kappab
to
a
higher
extent
than
aspirin
and
sodium

thus
in
addition
to
inhibiting
the
cox

at
therapeutic
concentrations
triflusal
is
able
to
block
through
its
metabolite
htb
the
expression
of
new

and
hence
the
resumption
of
pge2

triflusal
and
htb
may
exert
beneficial

in

these

useful
in
the
treatment
of
sickle

anemia
in
conjunction
with
therapy
to
reactivate
fetal
globin
genes
if
there
is
a
reciprocal
elevation
of
gamma
globin
expression
upon
repression
this
approach
could
be
useful
in
additional
hemoglobinopathies
we
previously
showed
that
repression
of
the
beta
globin
gene
appears
to
be
mediated
through
two
dna
sequences
silencers
i
and
ii
and
identified
a
protein
termed
bp1
which
binds
to
both
silencer
sequences
in
this
study
we
cloned
two
cdnas
encoding
proteins
which
bind
to
an
oligonucleotide
in
silencer
i
containing
a
bp1
binding
site
these
cdnas
correspond
to
hmg
i
and
hmg
y
isoforms
regarded
as
architectural
proteins
we
demonstrate
that
binding
of
hmg
i
y
to
this
oligonucleotide
causes
bending
flexure
of
the
dna
hmg
i
y
also
binds
to
a
second
oligonucleotide
containing
a
bp1
binding
site
located
in
a
negative
control
region
upstream
of
the
delta
globin
gene
suggesting
a
role
for
hmg
i
y
in
repression
of
adult
globin
genes
expression
studies
revealed
that
hmg
i
y
is
ubiquitously
expressed
in
human
tissues
that
do
not
express
beta
globin
being
present
in
48
of
50
tissues
and
six
hematopoietic
cell
lines
examined
furthermore
hmg
i
y
expression
is
down
regulated
during
differentiation
of
primary
erythroid
cells
we
present
a
model
in
which
hmg
i
y
alters
dna
conformation
to
allow
binding
of
repressor
proteins
and
in
which
the
relative
amount
of
hmg
i
y
helps
to
determine
the
repressive
state
of
the
beta

gene
class
ii
major
histocompatibility
class
ii
genes
are
regulated
in
a
b
cell
specific
and
gamma
interferon
inducible
fashion
the
master
switch
for
the
expression
of
these
genes
is
the
class
ii
transactivator
ciita
in
this
report
we
demonstrate
that
one
of
the
functions
of
ciita
is
to
recruit
the
creb
binding
protein
cbp
to
class
ii
promoters
not
only
functional
but
also
specific
binding
interactions
between
ciita
and
cbp
were
demonstrated
moreover
a
dominant
negative
form
of
cbp
decreased
the
activity
of
class
ii
promoters
and
levels
of
class
ii
determinants
on
the
surface
of
cells
finally
the
inhibition
of
class
ii
gene
expression
by
the
glucocorticoid
hormone
could
be
attributed
to
the
squelching
of
cbp
by
the
glucocorticoid
receptor
we
conclude
that
cbp
a
histone
acetyltransferase
plays
an
important
role
in
the
transcription
of
class
ii
genes
the
nf
kappab
family
of
transcription
factors
regulates
the
inducible
expression
of
a
variety
of
genes
recently
we
showed
that
elevation
of
intracellular
cyclic
amp
inhibits
nf
kappab
mediated
transcription
in
human
monocytes
and
endothelial
cells
without
preventing
nuclear
translocation
of
nf
kappab
complexes
the
present
study
examined
the
molecular
mechanism
of
this
inhibition
we
hypothesized
that
activation
of
the
protein
kinase
a
signaling
pathway
may
inhibit
nf
kappab
mediated
transcription
by
phosphorylating
proteins
such
as
camp
response
element
binding
protein
creb
which
compete
for
limiting
amounts
of
the
coactivator
cbp
here
we
show
that
the
amino
terminal
region
amino
acids

450
of
cbp
specifically
interacts
with
the
carboxyl
terminal
region
amino

of
nf
kappab
p65
rela
both
in

and
in
vivo
functional
studies
using
human
endothelial
cells
demonstrated
that
overexpression
of
cbp
rescued
camp
inhibition
of
nf
kappab
mediated
transcription
and
transcription
mediated
by
a
chimeric
protein
gal4
p65
286
551
which
contained
the
gal4
dna
binding
domain
fused
to
the
carboxyl

of

amino
acids
286
551
in
contrast
overexpression
of
creb
inhibited

p65

these
results
suggest
that
activation
of
the
protein
kinase
a
pathway
inhibits
nf
kappab
transcription
by
phosphorylating
creb
which
competes
with
p65

cd44
is
a
ubiquitous
molecule
also
known
as
hyaluronic

or
homing

however
the
cellular
functions
and
its
role
in
inflammation
for
example
rheumatoid
synovitis
are
currently
unknown
in
this
study
we
propose
a
novel
function
for
cd44
using
synovial
cells
from
rheumatoid
arthritis
ra
patients
we
demonstrated
that
cd44
cross
linking
and
binding
to

augmented
vcam

expression
and
subsequently

briefly
we
found
that

rheumatoid
synovial
cells

expressed
cd44

cross

of
cd44
markedly
but
transiently
augmented

5
the
integrin

adhesive
function
of
ra
synovial
cells
to
t
cells
was
also
amplified
by
cd44
cross
linking
these
results
indicate
that
the
adhesion
of
ra
synovial
cells
to
matrices
such
as
hyaluronic
acid
through
cd44
could
up
regulate
vcam
1
expression
and
vcam
1
mediated
adhesion
to
t
cells
which
might
in
turn
cause
activation
of
t
cells
and
synovial
cells
in
ra
synovitis
we
therefore
propose
that
such
cross
talking
among
distinct
adhesion
molecules
may
be
involved
in
the
pathogenesis
of
inflammation
including
ra
synovitis
during
beneficial
inflammation
potentially
tissue
damaging
granulocytes
undergo
apoptosis
before
being
cleared
by
phagocytes
in
a
non
phlogistic
manner
here
we
show
that
the
rate
of
constitutive
apoptosis
in
human
neutrophils
and
eosinophils
is
greatly
accelerated
in
both
a
rapid
and
concentration
dependent
manner
by
the
fungal
metabolite
gliotoxin
but
not
by
its
inactive
analog
methylthiogliotoxin
this
induction
of
apoptosis
was
abolished
by
the

zvad
fmk
correlated
with
the

of

also
augmented
dramatically
the
early

pro

effects
of

factor
alpha
tnf
alpha
in
neutrophils
and
unmasked
the
ability
of
tnf
alpha
to
induce
eosinophil
apoptosis
in
neutrophils
tnf
alpha
caused
a
gliotoxin
inhibitable
activation
of
an
inducible
form
of
nf
kappab
a
response
that
may
underlie
the
ability
of
tnf
alpha
to
delay
apoptosis
at
later
times
12
24
h
and
limit
its
early
killing
effect
furthermore
cycloheximide
displayed
a
similar
capacity
to
enhance
tnf
alpha
induced
neutrophil
apoptosis
even
at
time
points
when
cycloheximide
alone
had
no
pro

suggesting
that
nf
kappab
may
regulate
the
production
of
protein
s
which
protect
neutrophils
from
the
cytotoxic
effects
of
tnf
alpha
these
data
shed
light
on
the
biochemical
and
molecular
mechanisms
regulating
human

and
in
particular
indicate
that
the

plays
a
crucial
role
in

thus
egr

regulates

in
this

we
analyzed
the
regulation
of
nf

during

nf
y
is
a
ubiquitous
and
evolutionarily
conserved
transcription
factor
that
binds
specifically
to
the
ccaat
motif
present
in
the

region
of
a
wide
variety
of
genes
we
show
here
that
in
circulating
monocytes
nf
y
binding
activity
is
not
detected
on
the
ccaat
motif
present
in
the
promoters
of
genes
such
as
major

complex
mhc
class

gp91
phox
mig
and
fibronectin
whereas
during
macrophage
differentiation
a
progressive
increase
in
nf
y
binding
activity
is
observed
on
these
promoters
analysis
of
nf
y
subunit
expression
indicates
that
the
absence
of
nf
y
activity
in
circulating
monocytes
is
caused
by
a
lack
of
the
a
subunit
furthermore
addition
of
the
recombinant
nf
ya
subunit
restores
nf
y
binding
we
show
that
the
lack
of
nf
ya
protein
is
due
to
posttranscriptional
regulation
and
not
to
a
specific
proteolytic
activity
in
fact
nf
ya
mrna
is
present
at
the
same
level
at
all
days
of
monocyte
cultivation
whereas
the
protein
is
absent
in
freshly
isolated
monocytes
but
is
progressively
synthesized
during
the
maturation
process
we
thus
conclude
that
the
nf
ya
subunit
plays
a
relevant
role
in
activating
transcription
of
genes
highly
expressed
in
mature
monocytes
in
line
with
this
conclusion
we
show
that
the

repressor
that
inhibits
gpc91

by
preventing

in

the

zap

plays
an
important
role
in
t
cell

and

after

zap

is
phosphorylated
on

including

within

previously
we
demonstrated
that
y292
negatively
regulates
zap

function
and
that
y315
positively
regulates
zap
70
function
by
interacting
with

recent
studies
have
suggested
that
y319
also
positively
regulate
zap

function
paradoxically
removal
of
interdomain
b
to
create
the
construct
designated
delta
containing
the
y292

did
not
eliminate

here
we
show
that
delta
still
utilizes
the
same
pathways
as
wild

zap
70
to
mediate
nf

this
is
manifested
by
the
ability
of
delta
to
restore
induction
of

and
mitogen

and
by
the
ability
of

fk506
to
block
the

of

mediated
by

biochemically
we
show
that

these

that

that

it
is
now
well

that
chronic

is
characterized
by

of

of

some
of

are
known
to
modulate
the

of
a

of
genes
that
are
involved
in
the
immune

for
example
certain
oxidants
are
known
to
activate
the
nuclear

kappa

which
regulates
the

of
a

of

oxidants

also

this

composed

from

in

finally

these
observations
suggest
that
nontoxic

of
reactive

of

play
an
important
role
in
regulating
the
expression
of

involved
in

and
in

the

during

the

of

nevertheless
none

we

these

this
makes
the

pertinent
for

furthermore

points
to

by

since

it
is
important
to
understand
the

by

affect

we

although

enhanced

also
increased

suggesting
that

by
increasing

these

advance
the

the

however
the

led
to

which
could
both
be

confirming
that

il

however

allowed

il

treatment
led
to
a

junb

however
we

the

be
attributed
to

thus
the

this

due

surprisingly

did
not
cause

that

neither

we

that
the

be
explained
at

in

by

these

that

there

therefore
we
investigated

we
found
that

both

ctcf

the

the

kda
heat
shock
protein
hsp70
is
a
highly
conserved
ubiquitous
protein
involved
in
chaperoning
proteins
to
various
cellular
organelles
here
we
show
that
when
added
exogenously
to
cells
hsp70
is
readily
imported
into
both
cytoplasmic
and
nuclear
compartments
in
a
cell
type
specific
fashion
we
exploited
this
ability
of
hsp70
to
deliver
nf
kappab
a
key
transcriptional
regulator
of
inflammatory
responses
we
demonstrate
that
a
fusion
protein
composed
of
a
c
terminal
hsp70
peptide
and
the
p50
subunit
of
nf

was
directed
into
the

could
bind

specifically
and
activated

we
therefore
propose
that
hsp70
can
be
used
as
a
vehicle
for
intracytoplasmic
and
intranuclear
delivery
of
proteins
or
dna
to
modulate

the

because

therefore
the

be
explained
by
an

these

we
provide

we

demonstrate
that

augments

interestingly
nmi

nmi

therefore
our

that

because

such

we

to
determine
if

could
directly

such
as
ip

the
reduction
in

resulted
from
the

to
suppress

stat
factors
to

motifs
on

inducible

this
was
accomplished
by
preventing
the
ifn
induced
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
stat1
a
component
of
both
ifnalpha
and
ifngamma
induced
dna
binding
complexes
therefore
il
10
can
directly
inhibit
stat

early

gene
expression
induced
by
both
ifnalpha
and
ifngamma
in
monocytes
by
suppressing
the
tyrosine

of

this
may
occur
through
the
ability
of

to
induce

by

however

inhibition

was

furthermore
the

was
not

to

inhibition

was
not

because

however
suppression
of

was
associated
with

suggesting
a
potential
mechanism
by
which

may
mediate

these
findings
demonstrate
that
certain

including

and

antagonize
the
ability
of

to
induce

of

in

we
previously
reported
that
dexamethasone
dex
a
synthetic
glucocorticoid
causes
apoptosis
in

and
that
this
induction
of

is
prevented
by
specific
cytokines
namely
by
il

in

cells
and
by
il
4
in

we
now
show
that
this
differential
rescue
by
specific
cytokines
in

cells
correlates
with
the
level
of
ikappabalpha
that
is
regulated
by
dex
and
cytokines
in
both
cell

the
cellular

of

were
evaluated
by

interestingly
the

ikappabalpha
induction
was
completely
inhibited
by

but
not
il

in

cells
while
the
reverse

was
seen
in

in

the
cytokine
that
inhibits
the
induction
of

by

also
rescues
these
cells
from
dex
induced
apoptosis
although
the
rescue
cytokine
is
different
in
th1
and

our
results
imply
that
t
cells
need
to
maintain
a
certain
level
of
nf

in
order
to
survive
up
or
down
regulation
of

lead

infection
of

of

before
the

undergo

the
underlying
mechanisms
by
which
the

are
still
poorly

activation
of

seems
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
regulation
of
many
proinflammatory
cytokine
genes
but
cannot
be
the
only
mechanism
since
several
cytokine
genes
lack
respective
binding
sites
in

regions
therefore
we
additionally
investigated
other
transcription
factors
of
possible
importance
such
as

and

to
explore

we
investigated
the

which
may
be
important
to
substitute

the

in

the

regulation
of

in

seems
to
be
of

the

have
not

we
have
hypothesized
that
such

in

may
be
due
to
lack
of

of
the
transcriptional

we
used

to
examine
both

of

we
demonstrate
that
mrnas
for
all

of
these

are
expressed
in

by
the

of

resulted

within

however

of

was
still
blunted
compared
with

we
conclude
that
fetal
nucleated

constitutively
express
important
genes
for
cytokine
regulation
and
are
able
to
increase
intracellular
accumulation
of
the
mrnas
for

in

to

thus
qualitative
differences
in
the
capacity
to

could
not
be
shown
in

quantitative

these

that

we

that

two

the

shows
the

suggesting
a

for

a

these

indicate
that

during

a

we

further
we

that

this

account

these

demonstrate

the

indicated
by

furthermore
deletion

analyses
of

performed

revealed
that

finally

demonstrated
the

confirming
that

these

therefore
suggest
that
the

may
represent
a
pivotal
event
in
the

of

the

accessory
gene
product
vpr
can
influence
viral
pathogenesis
by
affecting
viral

as
well
as
host
cell
transcription
and
proliferation
we
have
investigated
the
effects
of
vpr
on
host
cell
activation
and
confirm
that
it
influences
cellular
proliferation
however
we
have
also
found
that
vpr
modulates

tcr
triggered
apoptosis
in
a
manner
similar
to
that
of
glucocorticoids
in
the
absence
of

mediated
activation
vpr
induces
apoptosis
whereas
in
its
presence
vpr
interrupts
the
expected
induction
of

this
regulation
of
apoptosis
is
linked
to
vpr
suppression
of

via
the

the

our
finding
that

can
regulate

supports
the
hypothesis
that
some
aspects
of
viral

are
the
consequence
of
cell
dysregulation
by

the
retinoblastoma
gene
product
prb
plays
an
important
role
in
controlling
both
cell
release
from
the
g1
phase
and
apoptosis
we
show
here
that
in
the
early
phases
of
apoptosis
prb
is
posttranslationally
modified
by
a
tissue
transglutaminase
ttg
catalyzed
reaction
in
fact
by
employing
a
novel
haptenized
lysis
synthetic
substrate
which
allows
the
isolation
of
glutaminyl
ttg
substrates
in

we
identified
prb
as
a
potential
ttg
substrate
in
u937
cells
undergoing
apoptosis
in
keeping
with
this
finding
we
showed
that
apoptosis
of
u937
cells
is
characterized
by
the
rapid
disappearance
of
the
105

to
110

prb
forms
concomitantly
with
the
appearance
of
a
smear
of
immunoreactive
products
with
a
molecular
weight
of
greater
than
250

the
shift
in
prb
molecular
weight
was
reproduced
by
adding
exogenous
purified
ttg
to
extracts
obtained
from
viable
u937
cells
and
was
prevented
by
dansylcadaverine
a
potent
enzyme
inhibitor
the
effect
of
the
prb
posttranslational
modification
during
apoptosis
was
investigated
by
determining
the
e2f

levels
and
by
isolating
and
characterizing
prb
null
clones
from
u937
cells
notably
the
lack
of
prb
in
these
u937
derived
clones
renders
these
p53
null
cells
highly
resistant
to
apoptosis
induced
by
serum
withdrawal
calphostin
c
and
ceramide
taken
together
these
data
suggest
that

acting
on

might
play
an
important
role
in
the

we
now

regulation
of

in

is
a
complex
response
involving
activation
of
two
forms
of

and
an

the
phosphorylation
of

on

residues
is
also
required
for
competent
stat

a
critical
serine
phosphorylation
site
in
stat3alpha
is
at
position
727
in
this
study
we
have
produced
an
antisera
specific
for

proteins
phosphorylated
on
serine
727
and
used
this
to
monitor
the
phosphorylation
of
this
residue
during
t
lymphocyte
activation
our
results
show
that
phosphorylation
of
stat3alpha
on
serine
727
is
not
constitutive
in
quiescent
t
cells
but
can
be
induced
by
the

interestingly
triggering
of
the

complex
or
activation
of

also
induces
phosphorylation
of

727
but
without
simultaneously
inducing
stat3
tyrosine
phosphorylation
or
dna

hence
the
present
results
show
that
stat3
serine
phosphorylation
can
be
regulated
independently
of
the
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
this
molecule
il

and
t
cell
antigen

complex
induction
of
stat3alpha
serine
727
phosphorylation
is
dependent
on
the

of
the
mek

pathway
previous
studies
have
identified
h
7
sensitive
kinase
pathways
that
regulate
stat3
dna
binding
we
show
that
h
7
sensitive
pathways
regulate
stat3
dna
binding
in
t
cells
nevertheless
we
show
that
h
7
sensitive
kinases
do
not
regulate
stat3
tyrosine
phosphorylation
or
phosphorylation
of
serine
727
these
results
thus
show
that
stat3
proteins
are
targets
for
multiple
kinase
pathways
in
t
cells
and
can
integrate
signals
from
both
cytokine
receptors
and

the

our

that

our

the

strongly
implies
that
these

share
a

the

showed
that
the

the

within

the

when

the

further
show
that
these

although

studies
as

as
the

that

plays
central

role
in
the

of

furthermore
it
is
highly

in

and
may
participate
in
the

of

we
have
therefore
investigated
the
transcriptional

of
a
myb
and
its
regulation
in
several
human

using
co

and
show
that
a

is
transcriptionally
active
in
all
the

studied
but
not
in

in

the

was
the
burkitt

the

of

in

not

was
observed
when
either
an
artificial

or
the

was
used
as

furthermore
the
functional
domains
responsible
for
dna
binding
transactivation
and
negative

previously
characterized
in
a
fibroblast
context
were
found
to
have
similar
activity
in

the
region
of
a
myb
responsible
for
the
b
cell
specific
activity
was
defined
to
be
the
n
terminal
218
amino

containing
the
dna

finally
a
110
kda
protein
has
been
identified
in
the
nuclei
of
all
the
b
but
not
t
cell
lines
that
specifically
binds
to
this
a
myb
n

domain
we
hypothesize
that
this
110

protein
may
be
a
functionally

although
the

have
been
studied
extensively
little
is
known
about
the
genes
that
are
placed
further
downstream
within
this
activation
cascade
and
that
are
transcriptionally
regulated
by
egr
1
to
identify
such
target
genes
we
established
egr
1
overexpressing
transfectants
from
the
murine
b
cell
line
k46
and
from
human
ramos
b
cells
all
clones
derived
from
k46
b
cells
showed
increased
expression
of
cd44
most
interestingly
expression
of
cd95
fas
apo
1
and
of
cd23
was
down
regulated
in
all
k46
transfectants
as
a
consequence
they
became
resistant
to
apoptosis
induced
by
anti
cd95
ab
treatment
similarly
the
egr
1
expressing
ramos
cells
showed
reduced
levels
of
cd95
expression
thus
egr
1
seems
to
control
the
expression
of
downstream
target
genes
not
only
as
a
transcriptional
activator
but
also
as
a
repressor
molecule
in
b
cells
egr

therefore
plays
a
critical
role
in
integrating
the
short

delivered
by
triggering
of
the

into
phenotypic

increased

has
been
implicated
in

we
therefore
compared
the

of
i

in

and
hela

both

display
a

in

although
i

is
considerably
more
stable
than
i

the

is
increased

in
contrast
all
other

i

tested
are
relatively
stable
in
both

the
elevated
turnover
of
endogenous
i
kappa
b
alpha
in
namalwa
cells
is
inhibited
by
a
proteasome
inhibitor
and
thus
seems
to
be
driven
by
the
same
degradation
machinery
as
the
slower

in

furthermore
we
investigated
the

stay
low
for
a
prolonged

nf

can
be
detected
for
several

after

we
found
that
removal
of
the

causes
a
rapid
decrease
in
nuclear
nf
kappa

a
phosphoform
of
newly

is
visible
when

displays
the

regarding

there
is
no

in

these

suggest
that

however

here
we
show
that

is
to
render

sensitive
to

this

is
dependent
on

one
of

that
binds
to

is

is
also
utilized
by

to
mediate
the

of

and
transcription
factors
during

we
found
that
binding
of
traf2
to
the
cytoplasmic
domain
of
cd30
results
in
the
rapid
depletion
of
traf2
and
the
associated
protein

by
proteolysis
these
data
suggest
a
model
in
which
cd30
limits
its
own
ability
to
transduce
cell
survival
signals
through
signal
coupled
depletion
of
traf2
depletion
of

and
its

increased

these

provide

can
negatively
regulate

conclusions
our

show
that
glucocorticoids
at
clinically
relevant

exert
specific
actions
on
expression
of
adhesion
molecules
on

neutrophils
which
are
mediated
through

by
which

we

we

even
though

in
addition
egr

both

were
required

in

transfection
of

could
drive

moreover

form

that
correlated
with

in

previous
studies
revealed
that
hsf2
consists
of
two
alternatively
spliced
isoforms
hsf2
alpha
and
hsf2
beta
whose
relative
abundance
is
developmentally
regulated
and
varies
between
different
tissues
to
investigate
whether
the
molar
ratio
of
hsf2
alpha
and
hsf2
beta
isoforms
is
crucial
for
the
activation
of
hsf2
and
whether
the
hsf2
isoforms
play
functionally
distinct
roles
during
the
hemin
mediated
erythroid
differentiation
we
generated
cell
clones
expressing
different
levels
of
hsf2
alpha
and
hsf2
beta
we
show
that
in
parental
k562
cells
the
hsf2
alpha
isoform
is
predominantly
expressed
and
hsf2
can
be
activated
upon
hemin
treatment
in
contrast
when
hsf2
beta
is
expressed
at
levels
exceeding
those
of
endogenous
hsf2
alpha
the
hemin
induced
dna
binding
activity
and
transcription
of
heat

genes
are
repressed
whereas
overexpression
of
hsf2

results
in
an
enhanced
hemin

furthermore
the
hemin
induced
accumulation
of
globin
known
as
a
marker
of
erythroid
differentiation
is
decreased
in
cells
overexpressing
hsf2

we
suggest
that
hsf2

acts
as
a
negative

of

the

the
results
demonstrate
that
alterations
in

specifically
the
failure
of
p65
translocation
to
the
nucleus
occur
earlier
and
more
frequently
than
the

in

these
defects
are
paralleled
by
an
impaired

these
initial

are
followed
by
the
eventual

and
a
marked

in

an

to

in
a
similar
manner
as

a
series
of
in

in

analyses
was
performed
deletion
analysis
showed
that

from
the

is
dependent
on
the

the
class

specific
transcription
factors
rfx
and
ciita
are
also
required
for

as
cell

deficient
in
these
factors
failed
to
allow
transcription
from
the
dm

in
addition
in

footprint
analysis
showed
the

to
be
occupied
by

not
in

of

none
of

was
occupied
in

indicating
that
they
may
not
be

finally
gel

showed
synergistic

formation
between
proteins
that
bind
to
the
putative

of
the

as

therefore
the

share
a

a

has
revealed
that

this

implies
that

can
result
in
the

which
may
play
an

in
the
pathophysiology
of

and
immune

to

the

analyses

predict
the
presence
of
three
alpha

each
with
a
high

using

we
found
that
two
of
these
predicted

are
required
for
full
transcriptional

by
ciita
moreover
a
ciita
protein
in
which
both
functional

have
been

displays
a

this

decreased

however
the

in

we
undertook

on

and
characterized
the

this

hmr
we
developed
a

mab
raised
against

hbd
for
this
purpose
mice
were
immunized
with

of

after

mab
18c7
was
selected
for
its

towards

this

recognized
both
the

as
well
as
the
hetero
oligomeric
mr
form
and
the
transformed

by
using
several
hbd

the
mab
18c7
epitope
was
located
in
the
n
terminal
region
of
the
hbd
from
thr729
to
leu765
we
then
studied
the
effect
of
the
antibody
on
aldosterone
and
progesterone
binding
to
the
hmr
when

was
incubated
with

it
was
able
to
partly
displace

the

from

when

was
incubated
with

before
aldosterone
or
progesterone
the
antibody
inhibited

the

the
effect
of
18c7
on
the

was
similar
with
both
hormones
a

analysis
indicated
the
simultaneous
presence
of
two
kinds
of

the
steroid

after
its
associated

especially
the
heat

had
been
cross
linked
with
the
hmr
by
dimethylpimelimidate
18c7
was
still
able
to
react
with

our
results
indicated
that
the

recognized
by

was
directly

in

supports
this
hypothesis
because
of
the

of

we
conclude
that
the

region
of
the

is
similarly
involved
in
the

of

previous
work
has
demonstrated
that
slp

a
grb2
associated
tyrosine
phosphorylated
protein
augments
interleukin
2
promoter
activity
when
overexpressed
in
the
jurkat

line
this
activity
requires
regions
of
slp
76
that
mediate
protein
protein
interactions
with
other
molecules
in
t
cells
suggesting
that
slp
76
associated
proteins
also
function
to
regulate

here
we
describe
the
molecular
cloning
of
slap
130
a
slp
76
associated
phosphoprotein
of
130
kda
we
demonstrate
that
slap
130
is
hematopoietic
cell
specific
and
associates
with
the
sh2
domain
of
slp
76
additionally
we
show
that
slap
130
is
a
substrate
of
the
t
cell
antigen
receptor
induced
protein
tyrosine
kinases
interestingly
we
find
that
in
contrast
to
slp
76
overexpression
of
slap
130
diminishes
t
cell
antigen
receptor
induced
activation
of
the
interleukin

in

and
interferes
with
the
augmentation
of
interleukin

activity
seen
when
slp

is
overexpressed
in
these

these
data
suggest
that
slp

recruits

the

of

a

have
received
renewed
attention
the
prolactin
receptor
a
member
of
the
hematopoietin
cytokine
receptor
superfamily
is
ubiquitously
expressed
by
cells
in
the
immune
system
certain
subpopulations
of

synthesize
and
secrete
biologically
active
prolactin
which
suggests
that
prolactin
can
act
as
an
autocrine
and
or
paracrine
factor
to
modulate
the
activities
of
cells
of
the
immune
system
this
review
focuses
on
the
molecular
actions
of
prolactin
in
the
immune
system
emphasis
is
given
to
recent
information
about
the
molecular
mechanisms
of
prolactin
receptor
signal
transduction
and
the
signaling
molecules
and
prolactin
inducible
target
genes
that
participate
in
these
responses
in
particular
the
prolactin
inducible
interferon
regulatory
factor
1
gene
and
its
roles
in
mediating
diverse
immune
responses
the
coordinated
production
of
all
blood
cells
from
a
common
stem
cell
is
a
highly
regulated
process
involving
successive
stages
of
commitment
and
differentiation
from
analyses
of
mice
deficient
in
transcription
factor
genes
and
from
the
characterizations
of
chromosome
breakpoints
in
human
leukemias
it
has
become
evident
that
transcription
factors
are
important
regulators
of
hematopoiesis
during
myelopoiesis
which
includes
the
development
of
granulocytic
and
monocytic
lineages
transcription
factors
from
several
families
are
active
including
aml1

ets
c
myb
hox
and
mzf
1
few
of
these
factors
are
expressed
exclusively
in
myeloid
cells
instead
it
appears
that
they
cooperatively
regulate
transcription
of
myeloid
specific
genes
here
we
discuss
recent
advances
in
transcriptional
regulation
during
myelopoiesis
phagocytosis
represents
an
important
physiological
trigger
for
the
inducible
expression
of
several
genes
in
human
neutrophils
here
we
report
that
a
dna
binding
activity
primarily
consisting
of
the
classical
nf
kappa

heterodimer
p50
rela
is
induced
in
phagocytosing
neutrophils
under
these
conditions
nf
kappa
b
activation
was
found
to
be
a
rapid
and
transient
response
reaching
a
maximum
by
10
15
min
and
returning
to
near
basal
levels
by
30
min
in
neutrophils
undergoing
the
phagocytosis
of
opsonized
yeasts
the
onset
of
nf
kappa
b
activation
was
paralleled
by
a
decline
in
immunoreactive
i
kappa
b
alpha
protein
levels
and
the
cellular
i
kappa
b
alpha
pool
was
replenished
by
30
min
in
agreement
with
our
gel
shift
data
we
conclude
that
nf
kappa
b
activation
could
constitute
one
of
the
mechanisms
whereby
the
expression
of
kappa
b
responsive
genes
is
enhanced
in
phagocytosing

to
our
knowledge
this
represents
the
first
demonstration
that
phagocytic
stimuli
can
induce
nf
kappa

activation
in
human
neutrophils
because

induction

thus

enhance

through

we
have
determined

the

show
the

with
the

being
engaged
in

the
importance
of

has
been
established
comparing

in

the

we
present
evidence
here
that

also
has
an
important
role
in
controlling

transcription
two
families
of
transcription
factors
that
are
required
for
normal
hematopoiesis
are
c
myb
and

these

act
synergistically
to
activate
transcription
and
this
synergy
is
required
for
transcription
of
at

several
important
hematopoietic

zeb
blocks
the
activity
of
c
myb
and
ets
individually
but
together
the
factors
synergize
to
resist
this
repression
such
repression
imposes
a
requirement
for
both
c
myb
and
ets
for
transcriptional
activity
providing
one
explanation
for
why
synergy
between
these
factors
is
important
the
balance
between
repression
by
zeb
and
transcriptional
activation
by
c
myb
ets
provides
a
flexible
regulatory
mechanism
for
controlling
gene
expression
in
hematopoietic

we
demonstrate
that
one
target
of
this
positive
negative

in

is
the
alpha4

which
play
a

leukocyte

this

in

the

we

in

the

is
at
a

three

of

however
and
the

has
yet
to
be

cd28

costimulation

which
is
vital
to
the
development
of

in

previous
reports
have
suggested
the
cd28

contributes
to
the
activation
of
the

by
up
regulating
the

have
suggested
that
nf
kappab
rel

make
up
the
cd28

other
work
has
not
supported
this
conclusion
recent
studies
suggest
that
the

cd28re
does
not
function
independently
but
works
instead
in

with
the

and
this
hypothesis
is
confirmed
here
also
in
the
current

ap

sequence
of
the

is
evaluated
although
four

can
be
detected
binding
to

only
one
of
these

is
specific
for
both
the

and
the

of

tested
this

the

that

c

are
also
found
in

these

indicate
that

the

the

the

in

derived

it
was
observed
that

increased

moreover
induction

these

has
a

impact
on

it
is

one
of

the

less

however
the
major
problem
still
remains
the

which
may
be
caused
by
the

our

indicate
that
although

the
degree
of

decreases
with

furthermore
the

in

is
less
than
in
the
corresponding
bone

obtained
on

there
appears
to
be
no
relationship
between

the

however
a

two

prompted
us
to
focus
on
the

first
previous

have
shown
this

to
be

second
we
found
that
the

activity
of

strictly

that

the

led
us
to

whether

bsap
might
play

in

we
investigated
whether
bsap
plays
a
role
in
the
transcriptional

of

in

our

showed

plays
a
role
in
both
il

cd40

upregulation
of
human
epsilon

bsap
is
unique
among
the
transcription

that
regulate

because
it
is

we
have
previously
demonstrated
that
experimental
expression
of
the
polyomavirus
transcription
factor
t
antigen
has
the
potential
to
induce
anti

antibodies
in
mice
two
sets
of
independent
evidences
are
presented
here
that
demonstrate
a
biological
relevance
for
this
model
first
we
describe
results
demonstrating
that
mice
inoculated
with
t
antigen
expressing

produced
antibodies
not
only
to
t
antigen
and
dna
but
also
to
the
dna
binding
eukaryotic
transcription
factors
tata

protein
tbp
and
to
the
camp

element
binding

creb
secondly
we
investigated
whether
polyomavirus
reactivation
occurs
in
sle
patients
and
whether
antibodies
to
t
antigen
dna
and
to
tbp
and
creb
are
linked
to
such
events
both
within
and
among
these
sle
patients
frequent
polyomavirus
reactivations
were
observed
that
could
not
be
explained
by
certain
rearrangements
of
the
noncoding
control
regions
nor
by
corticosteroid
treatment
linked
to
these
events
antibodies
to
t
antigen
dna
tbp
and
creb
were
detected
identical
to
what
we
observed
in
mice
antibodies
recognizing
double
stranded
dna
were
confined
to
patients
with
frequent
polyomavirus
reactivations
the
results
described
here
indicate
that
cognate
interaction
of
b
cells
recognizing
dna
or
dna
associated
proteins
and
t
cells
recognizing
t
antigen
had
taken
place
as
a
consequence
of
complex

between
t

and

in

in
the
context
of

reactivations
cd40
is
a
receptor
that
is
critical
for
the
survival
growth
differentiation
and
isotype
switching
of
b
lymphocytes
although
cd40
lacks
intrinsic
tyrosine
kinase
activity
its
ligation
induces
protein
tyrosine
phosphorylation
which
is
necessary
for
several
cd40
mediated
events
we
show
that
engagement
of
cd40
induces
tyrosine
phosphorylation
and
activation
of
jak3
as
well
as
of
stat3
jak3
is
constitutively
associated
with
cd40
and
this
interaction
requires
a
proline
rich
sequence
in
the
membrane
proximal
region
of
cd40
deletion
of
this
sequence
abolishes
the
capacity
of
cd40
to
induce
expression
of
cd23
icam
1
and
lymphotoxin
alpha
genes
in
b
cells
these
results
indicate
that
signaling
through
jak3
is
activated
by
cd40
and
plays
an
important
role
in
cd40
mediated
functions

frequently
act
in
an
instructive
fashion
by
initiating
intracellular

pathways
that
ultimately
target
a

of

these

in

trigger
a

that
ultimately
determine
the

and
provide
a
useful
model
in
which
to
dissect
the
role
of
this

in
il

we
found
that
although
il

stimulation
of
x

did
not
result
in
janus
tyrosine

3
jak3
phosphorylation
other
il

including

and
irs

were
phosphorylated
additionally
we
detected
signal

and
activators
of

stat6
tyrosine
phosphorylation
and
dna

activity
in
x

b
cells
with
a
wide
range
of
gammac
mutations
however
reconstitution
of
these
x
scid

cells
with
gammac
enhanced
il
4
mediated
responses
including
stat6
phosphorylation
and
dna
binding
activity
and
resulted
in
increased
cd23
expression
thus
gammac
is
not
necessary
to
trigger
il

mediated
responses
in
b
cells
but
its
presence
is
important
for
optimal

these

these

induce

a
mechanism

and

we
have

the

with

caused
topoisomerase

primary

which
was
rapidly
followed
by

by

these
effects
were
not
observed
upon

continuous

with
subcytotoxic
concentrations
of

produced
several
similar
effects
namely
decreased

accumulation
of

at

increase
in

mass
and
induction
of
differentiation
under
these
conditions
etoposide
produced
a
biphasic
activation
of
protein
kinase
c
which
consisted
in
an
early
transient
activation
from
hours

to

of

from

of
the

when
used
at

both
topoisomerase

caused
a

the

it
is
concluded
that
topoisomerase

inhibitors
may
induce
the
differentiation
of
promonocytic
cells
independently
of
their
capacity
to
cause
dna
strand
breaks
however
there
are
other
effects
such
as
the
early
activation
of
protein
kinase
c
which
are
probably
derived
from
the
production
of
primary
dna
breakage
by
some
anti

drugs
we
have
set
out
to
test
a
model
for

that

to
sequester

we
have
tested
the
changes
in

of

through

we
find
that
gata

activity
is
low
in
g1

in
mid

and
then
decreases
in

in

the

remain
high
in

m
gata

protein
and
mrna
vary
in
a
similar
manner
through
the
cell

suggesting
that
the
expression
of
the
gene
or
the
stability
of
its
message
is
regulated
although
a
number
of
transcription
factors
involved
in
the
control
of
the
cell
cycle
or
dna
replication
have
been
shown
to
peak
in
s
phase
this
is
the
first
example
of
a
lineage
restricted
transcription
factor
displaying
s
phase
specific
dna
binding
activity
one
interpretation
of
these
data
leads
to
a
model
in
which
the
peak
in
gata

dna
binding
amplifies
the
effect
of
early
replication
on
the
activation
of
erythroid
specific
genes
at
the
same
time
as
preventing
activation
of
non
erythroid

containing

these

may
also
relate

activated

have
the
ability
to
upregulate
the
expression
of
many
genes
in
particular
those
encoding
cytokines
and
chemokines
and
to
subsequently
release
the
corresponding
proteins
although
little
is
known
to
date
concerning
the
regulation
of
gene
transcription
in
neutrophils
it
is
noteworthy
that
many
of
these
genes
depend
on
the
activation
of

factors
such
as
nf

for
inducible

we
therefore
investigated
whether

are
expressed
in

as

and
that
the

resulting
in

the

found
to

also

the

of

resulting
in
the

to
our

this
constitutes
the
first
indication
that
nf

may
underlie
the
action
of

towards

these

a

hence
the

these

however
the

limit

approach

in

we

the

the
zebra

activates
a
switch
from

program
of
the

zebra
a
member
of
the
bzip
family
of
dna
binding
proteins
is
a
transcriptional
activator
capable
of
inducing
expression
from
viral
lytic

promoters
it
had
previously
been
thought
that
zebra
s
capacity
to
disrupt
ebv
latency
resided
primarily
in
its
ability
to
activate
transcription
of
genes
that
encode
products
required
for
lytic
replication
we
generated
a
point
mutant
of
zebra
z
s186a
that
was
not
impaired
in
its
ability
to
activate
transcription
however
this
mutation
abolished
its
ability
to
initiate
the
viral
lytic
cascade
the
mutant
containing
a
serine
to
alanine
substitution
in
the
dna
binding
domain
of
the
protein
bound
to
several
known
zebra
binding
sites
and
activated
transcription
from
reporters
bearing
known
zebra
responsive
promoters
but
did
not
disrupt
latency
in
ebv
infected
cell
lines
therefore
initiation
of
the
ebv
lytic
cycle
by
the
zebra
protein
requires
a
function
in
addition
to
transcriptional
activation
a
change
of
serine
186
to
alanine
in
the
dna
binding
domain
of
zebra
abolished
this
additional
function
and
uncovered
a
new
role
for
the
zebra
protein
in
disruption
of
ebv
latency
the
additional
function
that
is
required
for
initiation
of
the
lytic
viral
life
cycle
is
likely
to
require
phosphorylation
of
serine
186
of
the
zebra
protein

may
influence

dna
recognition

we
investigated
whether
this

be
partly
explained
by

with

we
demonstrated
that

changed

with

in

to
monocyte

to

ams
freshly

constitutively
expressed

decreased

although
at

hiv

as
seen
in

the
replacement
of
p50
homodimers
with
transcriptionally

following

in

may
partially
explain
the
progressive
increase
in
susceptibility
of
monocytes
to
hiv
infection
during
in

culture
the
change
in
nf
kappab
components
with

in

may
also
explain
the
different
transcriptional

of
these
cell

in

ascorbic

following

neither

also
had

on

following

these

suggest
that
the
molecular
mechanism

is
not

we
suggest
that
the

is
partly
controlled
through
the

furthermore
the

these

eth2

are
the
major
source
of

while

by

here
we
have
used

to
show
that

transcriptional

of

are
transiently
induced
during
the

of

into
either
eth1
or

cells
to
mediate
the

of

as
a

in

however
although
nfat
dna

is
similarly
induced
in
both

upon

only
the
nfat
complexes
present
in

are
able

relatively
little
nfat

in

neither

produced

but
the
high

of

transcriptional

directly
correlate
with
the
il
4
production
induced
in
response
to
antigen
stimulation
in
eth2
cells
these
data
suggest
that
activated
nfat
is
involved
in
the
effector
function
of
eth2
cells
and
that
the
failure
of
eth1
cells
to
produce

in

to

is
due
at

partially
to
a

of

be
therefore

under

the

involved

our

the

suggests
that

during

the

tyrosine

syk

are
rapidly
phosphorylated
on

and
enzymatically

upon

of

we
have
previously
reported
that

on

than
the

of

here
we
report
that

our

suggest
that

they

such

these
cellular

require
intracellular

pathways
such
as
the
four
map

mapk
pathways
in

the

is
thought
to
play
an
important
role
in
the
regulation
of

during

through
its

on
the

of

one
means
of
understanding
the
role
of
p38
in
these

is
to
identify
proteins
with

regulated
by

here
we

between

we

one

our

the

thought
to

there
is

also
increasing
evidence
that

the

may
thus
give
an

therefore
we

interestingly
the

by

we

revealed
that

the

atl

however
using

with

the

in

is
one
of

of

family
of

we
have
performed
domain
analysis
of

by
examining
the
effects
of
deletion
mutations
we
found
that
nfatx1
dna
binding
activity
and
interaction
with
ap

polypeptides
were
dependent
on
its
central
rel
similarity
region
and
that
transcriptional
activation
was
reduced
by
deletions
of
either
its
n
terminal

or
its
c

suggesting
the
presence
of
intrinsic
transcriptional
activation
motifs
in
both
regions
we
also
identified
a
potent
inhibitory
sequence
within
its
n
terminal
domain
we
show
that
the
inactivation
of
the
inhibition
was
dependent
on
the
activity
of
calcineurin
a
calcium
calmodulin
dependent
phosphatase
we
also
show
that
calcineurin
associated
with
the
n
terminal
domain
of
nfatx1
at
multiple
docking
sites
and
caused
a
reduction
of
size
indicative
of
dephosphorylation
in

we
have
mapped
the
inhibitory
activity
to
less
than
60
residues
containing
motifs
that
are
conserved
in
all
nfat
proteins
finally
we
demonstrate
that
deletion
in
nfatx1
of
the
mapped
60
residues
leads
to
its
nuclear
translocation
independent
of
calcium
signaling
our
results
support
the
model
proposing
that
the
n
terminal
domain
confers
calcium
signaling
dependence
on
nfatx1
transactivation
activity
by
regulating
its
intracellular
localization
through
a
protein
module
that
associates
with

is
a

the

it

we

here
we
show
that
in

the
igh

is
transcriptionally
inactive
furthermore
we
demonstrate
that

is
lacking
which
may
explain

therefore

increased

an

both

for

we
conclude
that

and
that
this

that

despite
these

the

by

remained

in

between
multiple
ets

both
in

in

this

is
mediated
by

and
the

region
of
the
rel

domains
of
nf

in
addition
the
ets
nf
kappab

interaction
requires
the
presence
of
dna
binding
sites
for
both
proteins
as
it
is
abolished
by
the

propidium

and
enhanced
by
the

of
synthetic

a

suggesting
that

is
required
for
the

of

taken
together
these

suggest
that
evolutionarily

are
important
in

both

which

here
we
demonstrate
that

which

dominantly
suppresses

and
that

these

that

the

which
encodes
a

is
described
as
a

during

it

at

in

however
lymphoid

rely
on
ikaros
at

its

is
essential
for
the
generation
of

not

although
the

a

is
detected
and
because

deregulated

implicate

in
addition
lack

and
selective

point
to

as

the
dominant

activity
of
ikaros
isoforms
unable
to
bind

and
their

in

suggest
that

works
in

with
other
factors
the
role
of
aiolos
a
lymphoid

in

a

network
that
controls

in

we

necessary
and
sufficient
for
the

of
the

at

this

ifn

contains
sequence
similarity
to
the

gas
here
we
demonstrate
that
the
putative

in
the
caev

binds
specifically
to
a
cellular
factor
induced
by
ifn

in

substitution
mutations
in
this

sequence
eliminate
binding
of
the

the
gas
element
from
the
70

motif
is
sufficient
to
confer
responsiveness
to
ifn
gamma
using
a
heterologous
minimal
promoter
consistent
with
the
binding
data
the
same
mutations
in
the
gas

eliminate
responsiveness
to
ifn
gamma
in
the
context
of
both
a
functional
caev

and
a

the
cellular

that
binds

the

is
present
from
5

after

with

nuclear
factor
to
the
gas
element
in
the
caev

is
inhibited
by

thus
the
gas
sequence
in
the
caev

is
essential
for
the
response
to
ifn
gamma
and
a
stat1
like
factor
binds

the

provides
at

a

albeit
at

reduced

most

therefore
the

of

as
had
been

second
in

our

here
we

inhibited
by

we
therefore
conclude
that

generated
by
the

of

the

are
necessary
and
sufficient
for

the

to
depend

it

since
the

these
findings
suggested
that
the

of

by

is
either
independent
or
only
partially

on
mek1
and
mek2
in

they
suggested
that
the

is
under
the

of
not

also
a

experiments

by

it

suggesting
that
the

the
finding
that

that

this

suggests
that

that

the

this

unexpectedly
the

in

potentiated
the

these

formed

and

the

from

we

the

these

strongly
suggest
that
the

leading
to

of

important
to

initiates
with

these

that

allowing
the

to
accumulate

to
determine
the

neither

nor
the

was
able
to
protect
the

from
apoptosis
induced
by

surprisingly
different
combinations
of
disabling
mutations
within
the
hlf
bzip

had
little
effect
on
the
antiapoptotic
property
of
the
chimeric

so
long
as

remained
intact
in

after

thus
the
block
of
apoptosis
imposed
by
e2a
hlf
in

depends
critically
on
the
transactivating

of
e2a
since
neither

nor

for
this

we
propose
mechanisms
whereby

the

our

our
objective
was
to
identify
the
mechanisms
underlying
such

using
reporter
gene
constructs
driven
by
the
cd4

we
report
that
hhv

can
efficiently
transactivate
such
genetic

activation
of
the
cd4

occurs
in
the
presence
of
the
viral

inhibitor
phosphonoformic
acid
which
limits
expression
to
the
immediate
early
and
early
classes
of
viral
genes
using
deletion

and
specific
cd4

mutants
we
identified
an

site
located
at
nucleotides
67
to
60
upstream
of
the
cd4
gene
transcription
start
site
that
is
important
for
hhv

transactivation
the
atf
cre
site
is
also
essential
for
cd4
promoter
activation
by
forskolin
an
activator
of
adenylate

using
electrophoretic
mobility

assays
and
specific
antibodies
we
showed
that
creb

binds
specifically
to
the
79
to
52
region
of
the
cd4
promoter
last
we
have
identified
two
open

frames
orfs
of
hhv

u86
and
u89
from
the
immediate
early
locus
a
that
can
transactivate
the

in

cells
however
transactivation
of
the
cd4
promoter
by
orfs
u86
and
u89
is
independent
of
the
cre
element
suggesting
that
additional
hhv

orfs
are
likely
to
contribute
to
cd4

activation
taken
together
our
results
will
help
to
understand
the
complex
interactions
occurring
between
hhv

although
the

their

which
exhibited

in

pebp2betamyh11
inhibited
neutrophilic

derived

coexpression

pebp2betamyh11
and
activated
nras
induced
a
more

characterized
by

indicative
of

these
results
show
that
pebp2betamyh11
can
impair
neutrophil
development
and
provide
evidence
that
alterations
of
pebp2
can
contribute
to
the
genesis
of

we
have
shown
that
an

of

leads
to
the

proliferation
and
to
the

the

demonstrates
that
a

of

promotes
an

in
stably

jurkat

as
measured
by
changes
in

of

h2o2
these
changes
are
followed
by
apoptotic
cell

additional

of
the

enhances
the
oxidative

the
long

exposure
of

to

eventually
results
in
a

of

that
have
lost

a

of
these

allows
the
recovery
of

in

our

indicate
that

although
little
is
known
to
date
about
the
regulation
of

transcription
in

several
indications
point
to
a
role
for
distinct
transcription
factors
such
as
members
of
the
nf
kappab
and
stat
families
in
this
study
we
investigated
whether
these
transcription
factors
become
activated
under
stimulatory
conditions
which
are
known
to
induce
gene
transcription
in
neutrophils
unexpectedly
we
found
that
conventional
procedures
employed
to
prepare
cellular
extracts
cause
the
release
of
proteolytic
activities
that
are
normally
stored
in
intracellular
granules
resulting
in
the
degradation
of
various
nf
kappab
rel
and
stat
proteins
to
circumvent
this
problem
we
developed
an
alternative
procedure
which
allowed
us
to
show
that
in
neutrophils
lps
and
tnfalpha
induce
a
nf
kappab
dna
binding
activity
which
essentially
consists
of
p50
rela
dimers
and
that
ifngamma
promotes
the
binding
of
stat1
homodimers
to
the
ifngamma
response
region
of
the

promoter
moreover
we
report
that
neutrophil

in

collectively
the

findings
open
new
perspectives
about
mechanisms
that
are
likely
to
regulate

in

the

described

specific
for

that

the
clinical

of

remains

a

been
the

in

haemopoietic
differentiation
is
ultimately
controlled
at
the
level
of
gene

which
is
mediated

an

many

the

previously

however
this

that

requires
additional

here
we
analyzed
large

for

and
interaction
with

the

is
only
moderately
augmented
by

but
certain

significantly
enhanced

some

thus
we
propose
that

not
sufficient
for

and
may
act
through

given
the

our

that

not
result

this

in

the

non

has
been
shown
to
be
critical
for

and

hence
in
the

does
not
occur
we
now
provide
evidence
for
a

which
in

to
that
of
the

is
independent
of

cd2
mediated
interleukin

production
occurs
via
activation
of

in

then
facilitates
the

of

c
fos

to

site
and
the

of

these

of

although
the

by

contributes
to

is
still
unclear
the
tax
protein
is
thought
to
play
a
major
role
in
this
process
this
40
kda
polypeptide
is
able
to
interact
with
the
tumor

p16
ink4a
consequently
tax
can
activate
the
signaling
pathway
that
lead
to
the
release
of
e2f
that
in
turn
induces
expression
of
factors
required
for
cell
cycle
progression
in
this
paper
we
demonstrate
that
tax
can
also
activate
e2f
mediated
transcription
independently
of
p16
ink4a
indeed
when
tax
is
coexpressed
with
the
e2f
1
transcription
factor
in
cem
t
cells
which
lack
expression
of
p16
ink4a
it
strongly
potentiates
the
e2f
dependent
activation
of
a
reporter
construct
driven
by
a
promoter
containing
e2f
binding
sites
this
stimulation
is
abrogated
by
mutations
affecting
the
e2f
binding
sites
in
addition
tax
also
stimulates
the
transcription
of
the
e2f

gene
itself
using
tax
mutants
that
fail
to
activate
either
atf
or
nf
kappab
dependent
promoters
and
different
5
truncation
mutants
of
the

we
show
that
the
tax

transcriptional
control
of
the

involves
at
least
in

the

its

in

we

demonstrated
that

by

these

indicate
that

and
inhibits

suggest
that

we

for

we
also
examined
the
possibility

the

show
that

that

ptdins

this

nfat

we

it

these

the

recent

a

interestingly
this

although
the

this

these

demonstrate
that

is
a
major

moreover
our

that

these

therefore
demonstrate
that

these

indicate
that

evidence

we

we

one
consequence

another

we
evaluated
the

in

whereas

showed

these

show
that
the

is
associated
with
important
functional

in

these

suggest
that

is
responsible
for

of
the

our

suggest
that
the

could
play
a
role
in

accumulating
data
from

have
recently
indicated
that
the

to

in
the
redox

of
cells
may
play
an
important
role
in
modulating
immune

the

of

been
recognized
to
regulate
a

of

that

might
occur
during

in
addition
aberrancies
in

have
been
implicated
in
the
immunopathogenesis
of
diseases
involving
immune

such
as

role
of
h2o2

other
reactive
oxygen
species
ros
as
an
integratory
secondary

for

has
been
complicated
by
the
fact
that

and
peripheral

differ
markedly
in
the
levels
of

additionally
proposed
pathways
of

have
been
based
on
indirect
evidence
provided
by
experiments
which
used
antioxidants
to
inhibit

further
complete
activation
of

requires
at

two
signals
one
that
stimulates
an
increase
in
intracellular
calcium
and
one
that
stimulates
enzymatic
processes
including

similarly
substantial
evidence
indicates
that
full
activation
of
nf

requires
dual
signals
the
ability
of
h2o2

ros
to
induce
t

functional

by
these

the

data
are
also

that
the

in

the
only
exception
was
hydrogen

at

which
did
not
induce

we
conclude
that
i
suppression
of

functions
can
potentially
serve
as
a
marker
of

its

lipid

is
only
detectable
in

using

we

the

thus
our

these

these

proerythroblasts

massively

we

that

was
expressed

we
also
observed
hematopoiesis

these

suggest
that
a
small
number
of
gata

hematopoietic
progenitor
cells
begin
to
proliferate
vigorously
during
early
adulthood
but
because
the

are
unable
to

this
leads
to
progenitor
proliferation
in
the

consequently
death
thus
gata

plays
important
in

roles
for
directing
definitive
hematopoietic

along
both
the

the

to
stimulate

or
it
modestly

in

the

was
in
marked
contrast
to
the
strong

additionally

furthermore
we

these

show
that

the

that

m

could
activate

these

finally
the

was
found
to
be
independent

the
results
suggest
that

can
upregulate

could
thus
have
the

further

thus
the

irreversibly
after

these

numerous
studies
have
shown
that
upon
hiv1
infection
human
promonocytic
u937
cells
were
induced
to
differentiate
as
indicated
for
example
by
increased
expression
of
adhesion
molecules
one
of
the
viral
proteins
involved
in
this
process
might
be
the
tat
protein
indeed
this
viral
protein
which
is
essential
for
productive
infection
has
also
been
shown
to
display
growth
stimulating
properties
and
immunomodulatory
activities
in
order
to
apprehend
the
role
of
the
hiv1
tat
gene
in
inducing
the
differentiation
of
hiv1
infected
u937
cells
we
have
successfully
introduced
this
gene
into
u937
cells
by
infecting
them
with
retroviral
particles
transducing
tat
the
effect
of
the
tat
protein
constitutively
expressed
by
these
cells
upon
their
differentiation
was
then
evaluated
by
looking
for
the
expression
of
the
c
fos
and
of
the
c
fms
proto
oncogenes
which
are
linked
to
the
differentiation
of
myelomonoblastic
cells
northern

analysis
revealed
in
these
cells
an
increase
in
the
transcription
of
these
two
proto
oncogenes
and
this
increase
was
amplified
after
treatment
with
phorbol
myristate
acetate
no
such
increase
was
observed
in
control
u937
cells
these
results
indicate
that
among
hiv1
gene
products
the
tat
protein
appears
to
trigger
monocytic
differentiation
and
suggests
that
this
viral
protein
directs
progenitors
of
the
monocyte
macrophage
lineage
towards
a
differentiation
stage
in
which
production
of
viral

and
virions
might
be
more

nf

is
thought
to
consist
of
two
components
a
ubiquitous

nuclear
component
that
we
have
identified
as

proteins
and
a
preexisting

specific
component
nf
atp
which
is
the
target
for
the
immunosuppressive
agents
cyclosporin
a
csa
and
fk506
we
have
previously
shown
that
nuclear
extracts
from

form
two
inducible
nf
at
complexes
with
an
oligonucleotide
corresponding
to
the
distal
nf
at
site
of
the
murine
il

promoter
although
hypotonic
extracts
of
unstimulated
t
cells
form
a
single
complex
containing
nf
atp
we
show
that
the
ability
to
detect
nf
atp
in
a
gel
shift
assay
which
is
essential
for
purification
and
biochemical
studies
of
this
protein
is
strikingly
dependent
on
the
precise
sequence
of
the
nf
at
oligonucleotide
used
as
the
labeled
probe
moreover
we
present
evidence
that
the
component
that
forms
the
faster
migrating
lower
nuclear
nf
at
complex
is
derived
by
a
calcium
dependent
cyclosporin
sensitive
posttranslational
modification
of
nf
atp
and
that
fos
and
jun
proteins
stabilize
its
interaction
with

the
results
are
discussed
in
the
context
of
a
model
relating
the

to

including
the

we
undertook
a
detailed
analysis
of
e2f
dna

activities
and
their

behavior
in
primary

three
e2f

were
identified
in

with

in

distinct
from
those
of
previously
defined
e2f

one
of
these
activities
was
found
to
be
a
novel

the
most
prominent
e2f

in
resting

termed

x
was
abundant
in
both
g0

but
disappeared
as

entered

suggesting
a
possible
role
in
negatively
regulating
e2f

complex

could
be
dissociated
by
adenovirus

with
a
requirement
for

however

failed
to
react
with
a
variety
of
antibodies
against

p107
implicating
the
involvement
of
an
e1a

protein
other
than

or
p107
in
addition
to
these
novel
e2f

three
distinct

were
resolved
in

these

suggested
that

protein
is
uniquely
associated
with
the

p107
complex
and
is
not
associated
with

together
these
results
suggest
that
e2f
consists
of
multiple
biochemically
distinct
dna
binding
proteins
which
function
at
different
points
in
the
cell

previous
studies
have
demonstrated
that
human
hl

cells
differentiate
in
response
to

this
event
is
associated
with
induction
of
the

and
appearance
of

the

the

that

respond
to

with

of

but
not
c

suggests
that

is
not

for

other

that

in
both

we

these

suggest
that

confers

we

we

these

indicate
that

underlie
the

in

the

block
the

emanating
from

thereby
inhibiting
the

using
these

as

chemists
and
biologists
have
uncovered
several
intracellular
signalling
molecules
bridging
the
generation
of

ca2
ions
and
the

activation
of

among
which
are
calmodulin
calcineurin
and
the
nuclear

of

nf

hence
ca2
binds
to
calmodulin
leading
to
the
binding
of
calmodulin
to
calcineurin
the
activated
calcineurin
in
turn
may
dephosphorylate
the
cytoplasmic
subunit
of

resulting
in
its
translocation
from
the
cytoplasm
into
the

to
form
a

as
described
by
jun
liu
these
drugs
manifest
their
effects
in
an
unprecedented
fashion
they
do
not
directly
intercept
intracellular
signalling
molecules
instead
they
form
tight
complexes
with
two
different
classes
of
abundant
cytosolic
receptors
called
immunophilins
upon
entering
the
cell
and
consequently
inhibit
their
peptidyl
prolyl
cis
trans
isomerase
activities
the
two
structurally
distinct
immunophilin
drug
complexes
bind
to
and
inhibit
the
phosphatase
activity
of
calcineurin
the

with
the

which
also
contain

both

to
form

with

including

is
sufficient
for

these

undergo

to

these
observations
suggest
a

leading
to

in
which
processing
of

rather

we
have
established

to

we
can
now
study
regulatory

of

experiments
that
have
not
been
possible
heretofore
although
the

involves
the
dramatic

it
should
be
possible
to
define
important
regulatory

that
can
then
be
assayed
using
less
stringent
systems
such
as

for

the
ideal
situation
would
be
analyses
conducted
in

however
these

have
been
impossible
to

given
the

it

then

can
be
used
as
an

we
feel
that
these

are
vital
to
understanding
the

of

during

ontogeny
how
does

regulate

like

once
we
identify
the

we

to

one

is
that

these

because

in

we

resulting
in
a
three

of

the

of
this

was
demonstrated
by
the

we
therefore
examined
the

augment
the

this

is

is

further
demonstrated
that

these

that

oct2

however
we

a

generated

for
the
capability
to
activate
an

in

our
analyses
show
that
several
oct2

can
stimulate

but
that
this

is
restricted
to

this
result
indicates
the
involvement
of
either
a

or
a
specific
modification
of
a

or
the

mutational

indicate
that
the

moreover
this

conferred

the

present

here
we

bsap
in

dna

in

a

bsap

instead
of

is
located
in
the

upstream
of

moreover
this

is
occupied
by
bsap
in

in
a
cd19

but
not
in

this
high

site
has
been
conserved
in
the
promoters
of
both
human

cd19

and
was
furthermore
shown
to
confer

to
a

bsap

to
be

we

in

the

present
in

that

thus

not
important
for
this
activity
of
t3so4
thus
it
appears
t3so4
has
no
intrinsic
biological
activity
but
under
certain
circumstances
may
be
reactivated
by
desulfation
the
induction
of
the
ap

transcription
factor
has
been
ascribed
to
the
early
events
leading
to
t
cell
differentiation
and
activation
we
have
studied
the
regulation
of
ap

in
human
peripheral

t

stimulated
through
the

phorbol

as

as
for

of

with

mobility

assays
showed
that
addition
of
anti

mab
to

treated
t

markedly
enhanced
the

activity
of
ap

to
its
cognate
sequence
the
phorbol

response
element
in
contrast
anti
aim
mab
did
not
induce
any
change
in
the
binding
activity
of
nf
kappa
b
a
transcription
factor
whose
activity
is
also
regulated
by
protein
kinase
c
the
increase
in
ap

binding
activity
was
accompanied
by
the
marked
stimulation
of
the
transcription
of
c
fos
but
not
that
of
c

blockade
of
the

with
an

demonstrated
a
direct
participation
of
c

in
the
ap

induced
by
anti

mab
most
of
the
ap

activity
could
be
eliminated
when
the
anti
aim
mab
was
added
to
the
culture
medium
in
the
presence
of
cycloheximide
suggesting
that
de
novo
protein
synthesis
is
crucial
for
the
induction
of
ap

binding
activity
these
data
provide
the
evidence
that
activation
of
human
peripheral
blood
t
cells
through
the
aim
activation
pathway
regulate
the
activity
of
ap

therefore
this
pathway
appears
as
a
crucial
step
in
the
initiation
of
early
t
cell
activation
events
both
normal
and
malignant
cells
contain
gangliosides
as
important
cell
membrane
constituents
that
after
being
shed
may
influence
cells
of
the

we
have
studied
the
impact
of
gangliosides
on
the
expression
of

in

and
in

although
under

stimulated

5
fold
in

and

was
more
efficient
under

conditions
looking
at
highly

gangliosides
gd3

gm2
and

were
all
effective
in
reducing
tnf
production
in
pbmc
and
in

by
factor
10
to
50
the
suppressive
activity
was
lost
in
molecules
lacking
the
sugar
moiety
or
the
lipid
moiety
gangliosides
appear
to
act
at
an
early
step
of
activation
in
that
tnf
transcripts
were
reduced
and
the
mobilization
of
the
nuclear
factor
kappa
b
was
blocked
furthermore
in
time
kinetics
gangliosides
were
effective
for
up
to
30
min
after
addition
of

but
not
thereafter
however
the
expression
of
the
cd14
ag
a
receptor
molecule
for
lps
lps
binding
protein
complexes
was
unaffected
by
gangliosides
finally
when
using
staphylococcus
aureus
or
platelet
activating
factor
as
a
stimulus
gangliosides
were
able
to
suppress
tnf
production
in
mono

cells
by
factor
5
to

as
well
on
the
other
hand
phorbol
ester
induced
production
of

was
similar
in
cells
treated
with

without
gangliosides
taken
together
our
data
demonstrate
that
tnf
gene
expression
in
monocytes
induced
by
different
types
of
stimuli
can
be
blocked
by
gangliosides
at
an
early
step
of

a

the

in

studies
in

have
shown
that
a

conjugated
with

to
provide
a

can
be
inserted
into
the

to
provide

we
have
investigated
whether

could
function
as
a

detected

not

in

could
only
be
detected
on
non

cells
from
1
of
3
hashimoto

and
from
0
of

control

because
of
the
efficient
binding
of
tg
by
surrogate

on
non

cells
we
assessed
the
ability
of
such
cells
to
present
tg
to
t

proliferation
in
response
to
tg
was
observed
in
t

from
only
1

this
low
frequency
of

was
no
different
from
that
previously
detected
using
cultures
of

and
autologous
dendritic

therefore
the
successful
generation
of
surrogate

on
non

is
not
associated
with
more
efficient
tg
presentation
of
t
cells
furthermore
the
significance
of
the
present
study
is
that
the

not
the

to

these

indicate
that

may
regulate
the

likewise
enhanced

that
had
only
a

both

and
the

of

acted
together
either
to
increase
c

decrease

as
well
as
increasing
ap

as
judged
by

furthermore
there
was
a
clear
cut
synergy
between
the
pkc
stimulator
and
the
camp
elevating
agents
the
results
demonstrate
that
the
simultaneous
activation
of
pkc
and
elevation
of
camp
leads
to
an
enhanced
ap

transcriptional
activity
in
a
t
leukemia

suggesting
that
the

may
have
functional
consequences
at

the
purpose
of
these
studies
was
to
investigate
the
modulation
of
the

of

obtained
from
peripheral

by

the
former
two
substances
interact
with
t
cells
via
the
glucocorticoid
and
beta
adrenergic
receptors
respectively
when
occupied
by
their
natural
ligands
glucocorticosteroids
and
catecholamines
these
receptors
have
a
role
in
modulating
t
cell
function
during
stress
during
the
inflammatory
response
increased
levels
of
pge2
bind
to
their

on
t
cells
and
thus
alter
responsiveness
proliferation
of
t

was
induced
by
immobilized

monoclonal

in
the
presence
or
absence
of
an
additional
costimulatory
signal
delivered
by
anti
cd28
mab
2
various
physiologic
concentrations
of
dex
iso
or
pge2
were
added
at
the
time
of
initiation
of
the
cultures
and
subsequent
proliferation
of
the
unstimulated
t
cells
was
determined
the
results
demonstrate
that
physiologic
concentrations
of
all
three
of
these
agents
inhibit
the
anti
cd3
mab
induced
proliferation
of
t
cells
3
although
dex
and
pge2
were
equipotent
in
suppressing
t
cell
proliferation
iso
was
much
less
effective
4
because
concomitant
elevations
in
the
peripheral
levels
of
these
substances
may
occur
experiments
were
performed
to
determine
the
t
cell
inhibitory
effects
of
dex
together
with
either
pge2
or
iso
synergistic
suppression
of
t
cell
proliferation
was
observed
when
various
concentrations
of
dex
and
pge2
but
not
dex
and
iso
were
added
to
cultures
this
synergistic
suppression
could
not
be
explained
by
an
increase
in
camp
accumulation
in
t
cells
stimulated
with
dex
and
pge2
5
finally
the
addition
of
anti
cd28
mab
to
anti
cd3
mab
stimulated
t
cells
overcame
much
of
the
suppression
of
proliferation
induced
by
pge2
or
iso
but
less
so
than
that
induced
by

previously
identified
at

cis

required
for

we
have
examined
the
dra
promoter
for
protein
dna
interactions
in
the
intact
cell
which
may
mediate
transcriptional
activation
using
in

genomic
footprinting
we
identified
interactions
in

cell
lines
at
the
octamer
site
and
the
y

class

antigen
expressing

maintained
contacts
identical
to
b
cell
lines
while
class
ii
negative
t
cell
lines
exhibited
no
interactions
in
lymphoid
cell
lines
the
octamer
site
is
occupied
and
required
for
maximal
expression
this
is
most
likely
due
to
the
presence
of
the
lymphoid
specific
otf
2
factor
in
contrast
the
class
ii
positive
nonlymphoid
glioblastoma
cell
line
does
not
exhibit
interactions
at
the
octamer
site
despite
the
presence
of
the
ubiquitous
otf
1
factor
and
an
open
binding
site
thus
the
dra
promoter
discriminates
against
otf
1
activation
at
the
level
of
dna
binding
in
the
glioblastoma
line
interferon
gamma
induces
class
ii
expression
in
this
glioblastoma
cell
line
and
in
parallel
up
regulates
x1
and
x2
box
protein
dna
interactions
while
all
other
interactions
remain
unchanged
these
results
suggest
that
interferon
gamma
functions
on
a
poised
promoter
by
altering
weak
nonproductive
interactions
at
the
x
boxes
to
strong
interactions
these
findings
provide
direct
in
vivo
evidence
to
strongly
suggest
that
the
modulation
of
x1
and
x2
interactions
is
an
important
constituent
of
the
interferon
gamma
induction
pathway

this

during

and
decreased
the

of

4
it
is
suggested
that
danazol
has
an
anti
estrogenic
action
to
the
monocytes
through
the
competition
and
suppression
of
estrogen
binding
sites
as
seen
in
the
estrogen
target
organ
a
major
difficulty
in
determination
of
glucocorticoid
receptor
sites
is
the
very
complicated
assay
procedure
therefore
we
describe
a
microtitre
assay
system
for
glucocorticoid
receptors
which
is
a
whole
cell
competitive
binding
radioassay
using
3h
dexamethasone
as
radioligand
this
modification
of
a
previously
described
protocol
simplifies
and
reduces
laboratory
work
and
allows
assay
reproducibility
to
be
controlled
more
reliably
thus
enabled
to
perform
the
test
on
multiple
blood
samples
in
parallel
we
investigated
cardiac
infarction
patients
over
a
12
day
period
to
test
if
glucocorticoid
receptor
binding
is
altered
in
this
stressful
disease
on
the
first
day
of
the
disease
glucocorticoid
receptor
capacity
was
significantly
decreased
without
alteration
of
the
receptor
ligand
affinity
whereas
on
days
4
and
12
the
number
of
receptor
sites
was
normal
again
this
result
fits
well
into
the

these

at

the
work
reviewed
in
this
article
separates
t
cell
development
into
four
phases
first
is
an
expansion
phase
prior
to
tcr
rearrangement
which
appears
to
be
correlated
with
programming
of
at
least
some
response
genes
for
inducibility
this
phase
can
occur
to
some
extent
outside
of
the
thymus
however
the
profound
t
cell
deficit
of
nude
mice
indicates
that
the
thymus
is
by
far
the
most
potent
site
for
inducing
the
expansion
per
se
even
if
other
sites
can
induce
some
response
acquisition
second
is
a
controlled
phase
of
tcr
gene
rearrangement
the
details
of
the
regulatory
mechanism
that
selects
particular
loci
for
rearrangement
are
still
not
known
it
seems
that
the
rearrangement
of
the
tcr
gamma
loci
in
the
gamma
delta
lineage
may
not
always
take
place
at
a
developmental
stage
strictly
equivalent
to
the
rearrangement
of
tcr
beta
in
the
alpha
beta
lineage
and
it
is
not
clear
just
how
early
the
two
lineages
diverge
in
the
tcr
alpha
beta
lineage
however
the
final
gene
rearrangement
events
are
accompanied
by
rapid
proliferation
and
an
interruption
in
cellular
response
gene
inducibility
the
loss
of
conventional
responsiveness
is
probably
caused
by
alterations
at
the
level
of
signaling
and
may
be
a
manifestation
of
the
physiological
state
that
is
a
precondition
for
selection
third
is
the
complex
process
of
selection
whereas
peripheral
t
cells
can
undergo
forms
of
positive
selection
by
antigen
driven
clonal
expansion
and
negative
selection
by
abortive
stimulation
leading
to
anergy
or
death
neither
is
exactly
the
same
phenomenon
that
occurs
in
the
thymic
cortex
negative
selection
in
the
cortex
appears
to
be
a
suicidal
inversion
of
antigen
responsiveness
instead
of
turning
on
il
2
expression
the
activated
cell
destroys
its
own
chromatin
the
genes
that
need
to
be
induced
for
this
response
are
not
yet
identified
but
it
is
unquestionably
a
form
of
activation
it
is
interesting
that
in
humans
and
rats
cortical
thymocytes
undergoing
negative
selection
can
still
induce
il
2r
alpha
expression
and
even
be
rescued
in
vitro
if
exogenous
il
2
is
provided
perhaps
murine
thymocytes
are
denied
this
form
of
rescue
because
they
shut
off
il
2r
beta
chain
expression
at
an
earlier
stage
or
because
they
may
be
uncommonly

the

to

is

to

selective

of

and

the
unique

contains

that
are
required
for

of

together
these
findings
suggest
that
the
nuclear

and
transactivation
domain
of

p65
constitute
a
bipartite
system
that
is
critically
involved
in
the

of

unexpectedly
our
in

also
demonstrate
that
i
kappa
b
mad

binds
directly
to
nf
kappa
b
p50
this
interaction
is
functional
as
it
leads
to
retargeting
of
nf
kappa
b
p50
from
the
nucleus
to
the
cytoplasm
however
no
loss
of
dna
binding
activity
is
observed
presumably
reflecting
the
unique
c
terminal
domain
that
is
distinct
from
that
present
in
nf

b
p65
we
have
biochemically

is

in

is
not

this

has
a

specificity
similar
to
that
of

but
is
unrelated
to
this
or

by

it
can
also
be
distinguished

similar

are

but
the

of

are
most
closely

to
those

in
which
the

to
be

no

has

that

of

the

of

it
is
evident
that
assembly
of
the
surface

of

with

to
form
the

induces
a
significant
increase
in

of

of

for

and
more
profoundly
for

this
provides
substantial
evidence
for
an
allosteric
effect
on
the
catalytic

of

that
is
imparted
by
binding
to
tf
its
cognate

it
is
also
evident

can
activate

are
created
from
either

both

to
constitute
a

structure
it
is
also
evident
that
association
of

enhances
the

these

a

of
the

that
the

bsap
has
been
identified
previously
as

that
is

at

not
late
stages
of

cell

biochemical
purification
and
cdna
cloning
has
now
revealed
that
bsap
belongs
to
the
family
of
paired

proteins
bsap
is
encoded
by
the
pax

gene
and
has
been
highly
conserved
between
human

an

was
shown
to
be
both
necessary
and
sufficient
for

of
bsap
binding
studies
with
several

demonstrated
that
the
sequence
specificity
of
bsap
differs
from
that
of
the
distantly
related
paired

protein
pax

during

the
bsap
gene
is
transiently
expressed
in
the
mesencephalon
and
spinal

with
a
spatial
and
temporal
expression
pattern
that
is
distinct
from
that
of
other
pax

in
the
developing
central

cns
later
the
expression
of
the
bsap
gene
shifts
to
the
fetal
liver
where
it
correlates
with
the

of

bsap
expression
persists
in
b
lymphocytes
and
is
also
seen
in
the
testis
of
the
adult

all
of
this
evidence
indicates
that
the
transcription
factor
bsap
may
not
only
play
an
important
role
in
b

differentiation

also
in
neural

the

is
activated
after
entrance
into
the

upon

factors
subsequently
increasing
expression
along
the
erythroid
pathway
contrasts
with
an
abrupt
downregulation
in

these
results
suggest
a

for

we
have

the

correlated

and
there
was
a

between

and

when

were

in

cellular

increased
and
a
more
pronounced
inhibitory

of

was
observed
on
the

of

we
conclude
that
the
cellular
glucocorticoid

levels
in
peripheral

leukocytes
reflect
in

responsiveness
to
glucocorticoids
in
mononuclear

from

and
that
the

may
alter
upon

in

encoding

on

the
data
suggest
that
differences
in
functional
responses
elicited
in
monocytes
by
all
three
factors
may
be
dependent
on
different
routes
on
nuclear
signalling
employed
by
the
factors
glucocorticoids
are
known
to
downregulate
interleukin

beta
production
in

cells
by
two
different
mechanims
direct
inhibition
of

gene
transcription
and
destabilization
of

now
we
have
examined
the
effect
of
the
nature
of
the
monocyte
activating
signal
on
these
two
inhibitory
mechanims
when
human
monocytes
were
preincubated
with
dexamethasone
for
1
hour
and
then
stimulated
either
with
bacterial
lipopolysaccharide
or
phorbol
myristate
it
was
found
that
dexamethasone
inhibited
the
lipopolysaccharide
induced
interleukin
1
beta
protein
production
but
the
phorbol
myristate
induced
production
was
increased
3
10
fold
this
difference
was
also
seen
at
the
mrna
level
when
dexamethasone
was
added
to
the
cultures
3
hours
after
the
stimulators
it
clearly
decreased
the
interleukin
1
beta
mrna
levels
regardless
of
the
stimulator
used
although
the
effect
was
clearly
weaker
on
the
pma
induced
mrna
thus
these
data
suggest
that
the
phorbol
myristate
induced
signal
prolonged
protein
kinase
c

cannot
be
inhibited
by
prior
incubation
with
dexamethasone
and
it
also
protects

the
degradative
action
of
dexamethasone

showed
that

this

except
for
the

the
amino

of
the
three

this
structural

suggests
that
the

encodes
a
transcription

however
upon

the

this

suggests
distinct
biological
roles
in
the

a

this

these

recent

offer
the
possibility
of
getting
some
insights
into
the
genetic

that
control

one

gpiib
the

is
produced

stage
of

whereas
the
other
subunit
of
this
complex
gpiiia
is
expressed
in
other
cells
for
these
reasons
the
5
flanking
region
of
the
gpiib
gene
was
used
to
identify
the
regions
that
interact
with

a

is
capable
of
controlling
the

specific

of
the

in

within
this

we
have
identified
several

that
are
implicated
in

interactions
as
shown
in

one

similar
to

these

support
the

than
the

the

hence
one
might
expect
that
a

enhancer
has
evolved
to
work
best
with
its
own

while
this
expectation
may
be
realized
in
some
cases
we
have
not
found
evidence
for
it
a

of
27
combinations
of

we

that
the

of
the

is
approximately
the

irrespective
of

i

there
was

notably
we
do
not

strong

when
the
immunoglobulin
kappa

or
the

is
used
to
activate

we
propose
that
a

is
of
evolutionary

respectively
in

the

deviate
from
the
normal

for
apoplexic
patients
with

localized
to
the
base
of
the
brain
as
indicated
by
computerized

the
diurnal
variation
of
gr
was
abolished
conversely
diurnal
rhythmicity
persisted
in
apoplexy
patients
whose
lesions
were
in
the
cerebral

thus
we
postulated
that
the
circadian
modification
of
gr
was
independent
of
the
diurnal
fluctuations
in
plasma
cortisol
level
or
the
circadian
variations
in
environmental
lighting
and
that
the
rhythmicity
might
be
regulated
by
the
circadian
pacemaker
located
in
the
human
basal
brain
these
diurnal
variations
in
gr
might
serve
to
coordinate
the

of
the

the

showed
that

also
requires
an

at

deletion

from

reduces

by
80

in

as
well
as

whereas
the
removal
of
the
octamer

site
reduces
transcription
to
levels
below

in
both

enhancers
containing
a

have
nevertheless
the
capacity
to
partially
activate

in

in
which
only

is
expressed
and
in
bja

cells
in
which
otf
2
is
the
predominantly
expressed
octamer

the
most
likely
interpretation
of
our

is
that
both
the
ubiquitous
transcription

otf

and
the
b
cell
specific
transcription

otf

can
activate

the

in

the

leads
to

to

the

these

this
indicates
that
the

due

not

these

that

partly
to

this

the

the

observed
were

in

to

demonstrated
the

the

is
a
critical
determinant
of
the

of

ectopic

of

cdna
was
shown
to
be
sufficient
to
reconstitute
at

some
aspects
of
this

in

we
describe
the
isolation
and
characterization
of
multiple
cdnas
encoding
mouse
oct2
from
a
mature

and
we
show
that
a
variety
of
isoforms
of
this
transcription
factor
is
generated
from
a
single
gene
by
an
alternative
splicing
mechanism
all
the
isoforms
retain
the
previously
characterized
pou
domain
and
are
therefore
able
to
bind
to
the
octamer

different
amounts
of
the
various
isoforms
are
present
within
the
same
b

regardless
of
the
developmental
stage
of
b
cell
differentiation
and
at

some
of
the
isoforms
are
conserved
between
mouse

humans
in
cotransfection
experiments
we
show
that
all
the

are
able
to
activate
an

in

revealing
an
unexpected

finally
we
show
that
one
of
the

encodes
the
previously

oct2b
protein
which
has
been
suggested
to
be

the

the

the
decrease
of
the

of

in

seems
to
be
a
compensatory
response
of

adding

overcomes
this

restored
their

furthermore

two

have
been
implicated
in

one
is
the

that
is
responsible
for

that

creb
like

s
the
other
is
a

interposed
between
the

in
this
study
we
demonstrate
that
a
subfragment
c26
in
the
region
between
the
21
bp
elements
is
involved
in
trans

by

through

formation
of
the

the

conferred
partial
responsiveness
to
p40tax
when
linked
to
one
copy
of
the
21
bp
element
that
by
itself
showed
little
activation
in

to

however
the
c26

alone
even
when

could
not
be
activated
by

in

the
c26
element
itself
was
profoundly
activated
upon

these
findings
therefore
suggest
that
the
htlv

contains
multiple
functional
elements
including
binding
sites
for
at
least
creb
and
nf
kappa
b
like
factors
which
synergistically
cooperate
in

of
the

our

also
demonstrate
that

a

platelet

is
a

mediator
of

studies
of
the

of

have
centered
mainly
around

in
this

we
begin
to

influence
of

on

employing
the

we
demonstrate
that

significantly
alters
membrane
phospholipid
metabolism
indicated
by
the
incorporation
of

into
phosphatidylcholine
phosphatidylinositol
and

but
not
significantly
into

at

ranging

m
the

lyso
platelet
activating

at
a
concentration
as
high
as
10
7
m
had
no
effect
on
any
of
the
membrane

we
also
show
that
platelet
activating
factor
from
10
12
to
10
6
m
induced
rapid
and
significant
elevation
in
intracellular
calcium
levels
whereas
lyso
platelet

was
again
ineffective
we
further
demonstrate
the
impact
of
platelet
activating
factor
binding
to
b
cells
by
measuring
platelet
activating
factor
induced
arachidonic
acid
release
and
5

production
moreover
platelet

was
capable
of
inducing

of

and

finally
we
explored
the
possible
role
of
5
hydroxyeicosatetraenoic
acid
as
a
regulator
of
arachidonic

liberation
demonstrating
that
endogenous

modulates
platelet

induced
arachidonic

perhaps
acting
at

in
summary
platelet

is
shown
here
to
have

and

in

with
the
results
of

tandem
copies
of
the
e6

stimulated
transcription
in

but
not
in

or

furthermore
a
mutant
e6
motif
lost
both
in

binding
activity
and
in

enhancer
activity
in
striking
contrast
to
the
mouse
ig
heavy

enhancer
in
which
the
octamer
motif
acts
as
a
b
cell
specific
enhancer
element
the
human
enhancer
contains
an
octamerlike
sequence
with
one
base
substitution
which
bound
octamer
binding
proteins
with
only
very
low
affinity
and
showed
no
enhancer
activity
of
its
own
interestingly
the
mnli
alui
fragment
could
suppress
the
basal

activity
of
the
conalbumin
promoter
in
both
jurkat
and
hela

moreover
simian
virus
40
enhancer
activity
was
blocked
by
the
mnli
alui
fragment
in
hela
cells
but
not
in
b
cells
thus
the
novel
enhancer
element
identified
in
this
study
is
probably
a
target
site
for
both
positive
and
negative
factors
the
involvement
of
ion
channels
in
b
and
t
lymphocyte
activation
is
supported
by
many
reports
of
changes
in
ion
fluxes
and
membrane
potential
after
mitogen
binding
human
t
and
b
lymphocytes
demonstrate
an
early
and
transient
hyperpolarization
after
ligand
binding
inasmuch
as
the
change
in
membrane
potential
is
dependent
on
elevation
of
free
cytosolic
calcium
the
hyperpolarization
is
presumably
through
opening
of
ca
2
stimulated
k
channels
we
have
used
charybdotoxin
a
known
inhibitor
of
ca
2
dependent
k
channels
to
study
the
role
of
these
channels
in
lymphocyte
activation
and
mitogenesis
we
demonstrate
that
charybdotoxin
inhibits
the
ligand
induced
transient
membrane
hyperpolarization
in
b
and
t
cells
in
a
dose
dependent
fashion
without
affecting
changes
in
cytosolic
ca2
however
blockade
of
the

is
not
associated
with
changes
in
cell
cycle
gene
activation
il

il

or
b

these
results
imply
that
membrane

secondary
to
the
ligand

opening
of
ca

activated
k
channels
are
not
involved
in
b
and

activation
and
mitogenesis
the

are
constitutively
expressed
and
localized
in
the

in
order
to
define
the
roles
of
these
two
factors
which
bind
to
the
same
kappa

enhancers
in
transcription
activation
we
have
prepared
somatic
cell
hybrids
between
iarc
301

and
a
murine
myeloma
most
hybrids
express
both
kbf1
and
nf
kappa
b
in
their
nuclei
but
one
hybrid
expresses
only
kbf1
the
kappa

enhancer
of
the
gene
encoding
the
interleukin
2
il

receptor
alpha
chain
il
2r
alpha
is
functional
only
in
the
hybrids
expressing
nuclear
nf
kappa
b
these
findings
show
that
nuclear
nf
kappa
b
is
necessary
to
activate
the
kappa
b
enhancer
while
kbf1
by
itself
is
not
sufficient
we
propose
that
kbf1
is
a
competitive
inhibitor
of
nf
kappa
b
and
discuss
how
these
factors
may
be
involved
in
the
transient
expression
of
il

and
il
2
alpha
genes
during
the
immune

we
report
on
a
computer
algorithm
capable
of
predicting
the
location
of
t
helper

epitopes
in
protein
antigen
ag
by
analysing
the
ag
amino

sequence
the
algorithm
was
constructed
with
the
aim
of
identifying
segments
in
ag
which
are
resistant
to
proteolytic
degradation
by
the

cathepsin
b

these
are
prominent
enzymes
in
the
endocytic

through
which
soluble

ag
enter
apc
and
resistant
segments
in
ag
may
therefore
be
expected
to
contain
more
t
cell
determinants
than
susceptible
segments
from
information
available
in
the
literature
on
the
substrate
specificity
of
the
three
enzymes
it
is
clear
that
a
cysteine
is
not
accepted
in
any
of
the
s2

s2
subsites
of
cathepsin
b
and

and
not
in
the
s1

s1
subsites
of
cathepsin
d
moreover
we
have
noticed
that
cysteine
containing
t
cell
determinants
in
a
number
of
protein
ag
are
particularly
rich
in
the
amino
acids
alanine
glycine
lysine
leucine
serine
threonine
and
valine
by
searching
protein
ag
for
clusters
of
amino
acids
containing
cysteine
and
two
of
the
other
amino
acids
we
were
able
to
predict
17
out
of
23
empirically
known
t
cell
determinants
in
the
ag
with
a
relatively
low
number
of
false
positive
predictions
furthermore
we
present
a
new
principle
for
searching
ag
for
potential
amphipatic
alpha
helical
protein
segments
such
segments
accord
well
with
empirically
known
t

and
our
algorithm
produces
a
lower
number
of
false
positive
predictions
than
the
principle
based
on

our

we

there
was

in

while
the

four

appeared
to
have
an

in

the
autosomal

form
was
characterized
by

as

in

while
in
one
family
receptor

in

were
normal
in

there
was
always
one

it
therefore
appears
that

the

that

may
be
able

at

here
it
is
shown
that
the

contains
multiple

of

the

is
the
first
regulatory

of

to
be
found
in

this
observation
raises
the
possibility
that

acts
to
facilitate
the
early

of

a
novel
b
cell
specific
transcription
factor
bsap
was
identified
as
a
mammalian
homolog
of
the
sea
urchin
protein
tsap
which
interacts
with
the
promoters
of
four
tissue
specific
late
histone
h2a
2
and
h2b
2
genes
as
shown
by
mobility
shift

interference
and
mutational
analyses
the
mammalian
protein
bsap
recognizes
all
four
sea
urchin
binding
sites
in
a
manner
indistinguishable
from
tsap
however
the
two
proteins
differ
in
molecular
weight
bsap
is
exclusively
restricted
to
the
b
cell
lineage
of
lymphoid
differentiation
its
expression
appears
to
be
activated
during
pro
b
cell
development
is
abundant
at
the
pre
b
and
mature
b
cell
stages
but
is
absent
in
terminally
differentiated
plasma
cells
moreover
bsap
is
clearly
a
b
cell
specific
transcription
factor
as
a
wild
type
but
not
a
mutant
tsap
binding
site
of
the

functions
only
in

not
reveal
any
high

binding
site
for
bsap
in
known
regulatory
regions
of
immunoglobulin

mhc
genes
suggesting
that
bsap
is
a
regulator
of
a
different
set
of
b
lymphoid
specific
genes
antibodies
are
produced
exclusively
in
b

the
expression
of
the

encoding

the
immunoglobulin
ig

is
also
restricted
to
b
cells
the
octamer
sequence
atgcaaat
is
present
in
the
promoter
and
the
enhancer
of
ig
genes
and
plays
an
important
role
in
its
tissue
specific
expression
this
sequence
motif
is
a
binding
site
for
nuclear
proteins
the
so
called
octamer
transcription
factors
oct
or
otf
factors
the
oct

protein
is
present
in
all
cell
types
analyzed
so
far
whereas
oct
2a
and
oct
2b
are
found
mainly
in
b
lymphocytes
all
three
proteins
show
the
same
sequence
specificity
and
binding
affinity
it
appears
that
the
b
cell
specific
expression
of
ig
genes
is
mediated
at
least
in
part
by
cell
type
specific
oct
factors
and
that
there
are
both
quantitative
and
qualitative
differences
between
oct
1
and
oct
2
factors
recently
a
number
of
other
octamer
factor
variants
were
identified
many
of
these
may
be
created
by
alternative
splicing
of
a
primary
transcript
of
one
oct
factor
gene
and
may
serve
a
specific
function
in
the
fine
tuning
of
gene
expression
the
transcriptional
enhancer
located
in
the
first
intron
of
the
immunoglobulin
heavy
chain
constant
region
is
a
major
determinant
of
b
cell
specific
expression
of
immunoglobulin
genes
like
other
enhancers
the
ig
heavy
chain
enhancer
contains
several
short
sequence
motifs
that
bind
specific
transcription
factors
each
binding
site
contributes
to
the
overall
activity
of
the
enhancer
however
no
single
element
seems
absolutely
required
for
activity
for
a
better
understanding
of
the
ig
heavy
chain
enhancer
components
we
have
cloned
and
analyzed
individual
sequence
elements
we
find
that
the
factor
that
binds
to
the
e3
enhancer
motif
catgtggc
is
a
ubiquitous
transcription
factor
it
is
present
in
an
active
form
in
both
b
cells
and
non
b
cells
where
it
can
mediate
transcriptional
activation
in
vitro
and
in
vivo
however
despite
its
ability
to
activate
transcription
of
a
transfected
reporter
gene
the
factor
is
apparently
unable
to
bind
to
the
endogenous
ig
heavy
chain
enhancer
in
non
lymphoid
cells
in
previous
experiments
by
others
the
characteristic
in
vivo
footprint
of
this
factor
designated
nf
mue3
was
detected
in
b
cells
but
not
in
non
b
cells
from
this
and
other
findings
the
picture
emerges
that
there
are
at
least
three
categories
of
factors
which
mediate
cell
type
specific
transcription
in
b
lymphocytes
a
cell
specific
factors
such
as
oct
2a
and
oct
2b
that
are
not
expressed
in
most
other
cell
types
b
ubiquitous
factors
such
as
nf
kappa
b
that
are
constitutively
active
in
b
cells
but
are
sequestered
in
an
inactive
form
in
other
cells
c
ubiquitously
active
factors
exemplified
by
the
one
binding
to
the
e3
sequence
motif
this
factor
is
present
in
an
active
form
in
a
variety
of
cell
types
but
is
apparently
unable
to
bind
to
the
endogenous
ig
heavy

enhancer
in
non
b
cells
perhaps
due
to
a
non
permissive
chromatin
structure
of
the

previous

however
there
was

the

was

by

in

the

and
the

remained
elevated
at

after

we
also
observed
the

simultaneously
with

the

a

the

is
inhibited
only
if

is
completely

this
suggests
a
model
in

be
activated

distinguishable
by

the

the

we
propose
that
ntf

remarkably
these

inhibit

actions
raising
the
possibility
that
both
act
by

of

we
find
that

to

however
an

the

may
be
explained
by
the

by
the

that

neither

of

is
sufficient
to
explain
the

of

rather
these
findings
suggest
that

interferes
with

this

accompanied
by

we
hypothesized
that

itself

for
a

the

the

was
unaltered
by

the

these

in

the

this

cannot
be

heritable

further
results
in
which
beta

indicate
that
the

the

deletional

only

by

these

that

that

we
demonstrate
that

this

moreover
combined

in

our

indicate
that

that

this

we

the

the

these

suggest
that
the

in

may
be
at

in

due
to
its

abolishes

further

reveals
that

maps
to
two
serines
in
the

of

and
that
the

although
the

in

is
well
documented
its

of

still
remains
to
be

we
investigated
here
the
question
of
the
regulation
of
platelet
ca

atpases
by
cyclic
amp
through
the
phosphorylation
of
the
rap1

using
a
pathological
model
we
first
found
experimental
conditions
where
ca

transport
by
platelet
membrane
vesicles
appeared
to
be
dependent
on
the
phosphorylation
of
the
rap1

then
we
studied

of

for
their
expression
of
the
potential
97

of

through

as

as
the

using
the
catalytic

of
the
cyclic

in

studied
we
found
no

by
western

using
the
pl

which
specifically
recognized
this
isoform
in
contrast
the
rap1
protein
was
differentially
phosphorylated
when
using
15
micrograms

of
the

these
results
allowed
us
to
use
these
pathological
platelets
to
study
the
relationship
between
the
expression
of
rap1
protein
and
the
regulation
of
ca2
transport
by
selecting
a
patient
with
severe
heart

we
could
show
a
decrease
in
the
expression
as
well
as
in
the
phosphorylation
of
rap1
protein
and
demonstrate
a
lower
effect
of
c
sub
on
ca2
transport
finally
by
studying
a
further
series
of
patients
we
could
confirm
that
the
decrease
in
rap1
protein
expression
in
heart
failure
whatever
its
extent
was
variable
and
could
strictly
correlate
the
expression
of
rap1
protein
with
the
stimulatory
effect
of
c
sub
on
ca2
transport
besides
the
evidence
for
regulation
of
the
expression
of
the
rap1
protein
in
platelets
from
patients
with
heart

these
findings
constitute
a
new
approach
in

of
the

of

through
the

of
the

the

the

this

which
synergizes
with
the

these

the

of

and

to

supports
the
concept
of
heterotrans
activation
of
jak1
and
jak3
caused
by
il

induced
heterodimerization
of
their

partners
the
present
study
verified
the
ability
of
il
2
to
cause
tyrosine
phosphorylation
and
activation
of
jak1
and
jak3
but
demonstrated
that
il
2
stimulated
jak3
to
a
significantly
larger
extent
than
jak1
in
human

lymphocytes
and
the
yt
cell

this
conclusion
was
based
upon
several
independent
criteria
including
more
vigorous
tyrosine
phosphorylation
of
jak3
more
marked
enzymatic
activation
of
jak3
as
well
as
higher
abundance
of
jak3
in

furthermore
when

robust
il

induced
proliferation
and
jak3

occurred
without
detectable
involvement
of
either
jak1
jak2
or
tyk2
we
therefore
propose
that
il
2
receptor
signal
transduction
does
not
depend
on
equimolar
heterodimerization
of
jak1
and
jak3
following
il

nonetheless
a

critical
for

activation
and
the

increased
with

suggesting
that
stabilization
of

binding
to

relies
on
both

was
determined
initially
by

these

are
the
first
to

of

these

strongly
suggest
that
the

previous

has
demonstrated
that
a
significant
amount
of

variance
after

in

breast

patients
could
be
accounted
for
by
both
the
estrogen

er
status
of
the

and
by
social
factors
namely
perceived
social
support
and
seeking
social
support
as
a
general
coping
strategy
as
considerable
evidence
has
accumulated
that
social
support
in
both
animal
and
human

may
have
survival
value
we
sought
to
test
the
reliability
of
this

obtained
at

months
after

to

in
this

of

it
was
found
that
the
most
significant
variable
predicting

at

was
tumor

with
higher

with

in

seeking

as
a

as

if
as
the

suggests
nk

is
relevant
to

control
and
since
er
tumors
have
a
worse
prognosis
we
suggest
here
that
perhaps
such
tumors
are
resistant
to
control
by
nk
cells
because
they
lack
the
ability
to
attract
an
accumulation
of
effector
cells
to
the
tumor
site
or
because
blocking
factors
at
the
site
of
the
tumor
prevent
local
tumor
control
at
the
site
of
action
the
finding
related
to
social
support
also
replicates
results
from
an
independent

of

this
finding
taken
together
with
other
evidence
that
this
social

is
associated
with
longer

in

underscores
the
potential
importance
of
this

the

these

a
notion
corroborated

one

this

we
linked

we

that
both

can
activate

the
results
obtained
by

suggest
that
the

however
activation
from

could
only
be
achieved
with
the

of

in

in

were
observed
suggesting
that
distinct

with
the

of

might
be
involved
in

furthermore
we
identified
a

at
the

of

these

underscore
the

although

in

we

the

can
be
formed
by

which
do
not
express

not

furthermore
we
demonstrate
that
the
pu

binds
to

found
on
a

of
myeloid

and
its
formation
requires
an

adjacent

a

expression
of

in

deletion

results
in
a

in

that

of

finally
we

acute

was
induced
by
an

of

this

was

inhibited
by

of
the

with
a

of

alpha

approaching
those
found
in

in

treatment
of

these

demonstrate
that

oxidative
stress
may
modulate
liver
injury
perhaps
through
an
effect
on
cytotoxic
cytokine
synthesis
glucocorticoids
are
among
the
most
potent
anti
inflammatory
and
immunosuppressive
agents
they
inhibit
synthesis
of
almost
all
known
cytokines
and
of
several
cell
surface
molecules
required
for
immune
function
but
the
mechanism
underlying
this
activity
has
been
unclear
here
it
is
shown
that
glucocorticoids
are
potent
inhibitors
of
nuclear

nf
kappa

in

and

this

is
mediated
by
induction
of
the

kappa

alpha
inhibitory
protein
which
traps
activated
nf
kappa

in
inactive
cytoplasmic
complexes
because
nf
kappa
b
activates
many
immunoregulatory
genes
in
response
to
pro

the
inhibition
of

can
be
a
major

suggesting
that
it
is
a

on

by

we
therefore
examined

by

with

the

but
also

not
repress

these
results
indicate
that
dna

by
vdr
is
necessary
but
not
sufficient
to
mediate
il

repression
by
combining
partially
purified

in

we
observed
the

that

this
direct

by
a
nuclear

of

of
the

may
provide
a
mechanistic
explanation
of
how
vitamin

can
act
as
potent

the

lipoxygenase
lox
gene
is
expressed
in
a
tissue
specific
manner
predominantly
in
erythroid
cells
but
also
in
airway
epithelial
cells
and
eosinophils
we
demonstrate
in
this
report
that
the
5
flanking
dna
of
the
15
lox
gene
contains
sequences
which
down
regulate
its
activity
in
a
variety
of
non
erythroid
cell
lines
but
not
in
two
erythroid
cell
lines
the
element
has
characteristics
of
a
transcriptional
silencer
since
it
functions
in
both
orientations
the
main
activity
of
the
silencer
has
been
mapped
to
the
first
900
bp
of
5
flanking
dna
which
contains
nine
binding
sites
for
a
nuclear
factor
present
in
non
erythroid
cells
but
not
in
erythroid
cells
these
binding
sites
have
similar
sequences
and
multiple
copies
of
the
binding
sites
confer
tissue
specific
down
regulation
when
attached
to
a
minimal
lox

fragment
the
5
flanking

also
contains
a
cluster
of
three
binding
sites
for
the

family
of
transcription
factors
cyclosporin
a
csa
exerts
its
immunosuppressive
effect
by
inhibiting
the
activity
of
nuclear
factor
of
activated
t

nfat
thus
preventing
transcriptional
induction
of
several
cytokine
genes
this
effect
is
thought
to
be
largely
mediated
through
inactivation
of
the
phosphatase
calcineurin
which
in
turn
inhibits
translocation
of
an
nfat
component
to
the
nucleus
here
we
report
that
csa
treatment
of
raji
b
and
jurkat
t
cell
lines
yields
a
phosphorylated
form
of
nfatp
that
is
inhibited
in
dna
binding
and
in
its
ability
to
form
an
nfat
complex
with
fos
and
jun
immunoblot
analyses
and
metabolic
labeling
with
32p
orthophosphate
show
that
csa
alters
nfatp
migration
on
sds
polyacrylamide
gel
electrophoresis
by
increasing
its
phosphorylation
level
without
affecting
subcellular
distribution
dephosphorylation
by
in

treatment
with
calcineurin
or
alkaline
phosphatase
restores
nfatp
dna
binding
activity
and
its
ability
to
reconstitute
an
nfat
complex
with
fos
and
jun
proteins
these
data
point
to
a
new
mechanism
for
csa
sensitive
regulation
of
nfatp
in
which
dephosphorylation
is
critical
for
dna
binding
we
previously
have
demonstrated
a
requirement
for
oxidative
events
during
cell
cycle
entry
in
t
lymphocytes
and
have
hypothesised
that
reactive
oxygen
species
may
act
as
intracellular
signalling
agents
during
lymphocyte
activation
in
the
current
study
cysteamine
an
aminothiol
compound
with
antioxidant
activity
has
been
used
to
further
investigate
the
role
of
oxidative
signalling
during
lymphocyte

treatment
of
normal
human
peripheral
blood
lymphocytes
with
cysteamine
in

was
found
to
inhibit
proliferation
in
a
dose
dependent
manner
with
essentially
complete
inhibition
occurring
at
a
dose
of
400
microm
this
inhibitory
effect
was
limited
to
the
first
2
h
after
mitogenic
activation
localizing
the
time
frame
of
action
of
cysteamine
to
within
the
commitment
period
it
therefore
was
of
interest
to
establish
which
if
any
commitment
events
were
affected
by
oxidative
signalling
during
cell
cycle
entry
taking
the
il
2
gene
as
a
candidate
we
examined
the
effect
of
cysteamine
treatment
on
early
gene
expression
during
lymphocyte
activation
and
on
the
activity
of
transcription
factors

whose

are

cysteamine
treatment
inhibited
both
expression
of
the
il
2
mrna
and
secretion
of
il

into
the
culture
medium
the
inhibitory
effect
of
cysteamine
may
be
mediated
at
least
in
part
by
an
effect
on
transcription
factor
function
as
the
dna
binding
activities
of
ap

extracted
from
mitogen

were
significantly
inhibited
by
cysteamine
treatment
interestingly
oct1
and
nf
at
dna
binding
activity
were
not
affected
by
cysteamine
treatment
suggesting
that
oxidative

processes
operate
in
a
selective
manner
the
identification
of
regulatory
proteins
such
as
transcription
factors
as
molecular
targets
for
oxidative

provides
further
evidence
to
implicate
oxidative

being

transcriptional

by

here
we

two

these

the
clinical

in
the

may
be
related
to
their

that

the
induction
of

was
inhibited
completely
by

with
either

a
thus
indicating
that
the

prior

here
we

located

this

the

and
a

we
find
that
the
packaging
of

in

strongly
represses
hiv

and
that

can
be
counteracted
efficiently
by

that

in

we
conclude
that
transcription
activation
by

is
a

that
