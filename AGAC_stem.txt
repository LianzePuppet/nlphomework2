method to clarifi the relationship between express of p53 gof mutat p53-r175h and invas potenti of human endometri cancer kle cell we test the consequ of up-regul and down-regul of p53-r175h in kle

of cyp pharmacogenet in the bioactiv of cyclophosphamid is still controversi recent clinic studi have suggest a role for either cyp2c19 or cyp2b6 the aim of this studi was to clarifi the role of these pharmacogen method we use a combin in vitro-in vivo approach to determin the role of these pharmacogen in the bioactiv of the prodrug to 4-hydroxi cyclophosphamid 4-ohcp cyclophosphamid metabol was determin in a human liver biobank n 14 and in patient receiv the drug for treatment of lupus nephriti n 16 result in liver of known cyp2c19 and cyp2b6 genotyp and protein express we observ that there was a combin role for both cyp2c19 and cyp2b6 in the bioactiv of cyclophosphamid in vitro the presenc of at least one loss of function lof allel at either cyp2c19 or cyp2b6 result in a signific decreas in both v max p 0 028 and cl int p 0 0017 compar with liver with no lof allel this dual genotyp relationship was also observ in a preliminari clinic studi with patient who had ≥1 lof allel at either cyp2c19 or cyp2b6 also display signific p 0 0316 lower bioactiv of cyclophosphamid the mean 4-ohcp cp bioactiv ratio was 0 0014 95 ci 0 0007 0 002 compar with 0 0071 95 ci 0 0001 0 014 in patient with no lof allel at either of these gene conclus the presenc of ≥1 lof allel s at either cyp2b6 or cyp2c19 appear to result in decreas bioactiv of cyclophosphamid both in vitro and in patient further clinic studi to confirm this relationship are warrant more than half of all human cancer are associ with mutat of the tp53 gene in regard to the function interact with the remain wild-typ wt
